# Project Brief: Krypton Graph

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** Krypton Graph is a comprehensive knowledge graph management platform that transforms disparate document sources (PDFs, Zoom transcripts, emails) into a unified, queryable knowledge graph using Anthropic's contextual retrieval methodology with intelligent chunking optimized for AI processing.

**Primary Problem:** Organizations lose up to 70% of potential value from their information assets due to knowledge fragmentation across multiple document repositories, with no unified processing pipeline or context-aware chunking that respects API constraints.

**Target Market:** Knowledge workers and organizations managing complex document repositories who need to extract structured insights from unstructured data while maintaining complete traceability and audit trails.

**Key Value Proposition:** The only solution that combines visual ontology design, clone-before-modify safety patterns, and intelligent chunking (respecting 10K char limits) to deliver >50 docs/hour processing with >98% success rate and complete source traceability.

## Problem Statement

The modern enterprise faces a critical knowledge management crisis. Organizations accumulate thousands of documents across BOX folders, Zoom transcripts, Exchange emails, and various repositories, yet lack unified access to this knowledge. Current solutions fail on multiple fronts:

**Current State:** Knowledge workers spend 20% of their time searching for information, with 42% unable to find the documents they need. Documents exist in silos - PDFs in BOX, transcripts in Zoom, emails in Exchange - with no semantic connections between related content.

**Quantified Impact:** 
- Average knowledge worker wastes 2.5 hours daily searching across systems
- 70% of organizational knowledge value remains untapped due to fragmentation
- Compliance risks from inability to trace decisions back to source documents
- $15,000 per employee annual productivity loss from inefficient knowledge access

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Generic document management systems lack semantic understanding and graph relationships
- Current AI solutions don't respect API constraints (e.g., Zep's 10K character limit)
- No existing platform provides both visual ontology design AND impact assessment
- Traditional systems lose context during chunking, reducing AI retrieval effectiveness

**Urgency:** With AI adoption accelerating, organizations need their knowledge AI-ready NOW. Every month of delay means competitors gain advantage through better knowledge utilization. Regulatory requirements increasingly demand complete audit trails that current systems cannot provide.

## Proposed Solution

Krypton Graph addresses the knowledge fragmentation crisis through a revolutionary approach that treats documents not as files, but as interconnected knowledge waiting to be unlocked.

**Core Concept:** A unified knowledge graph platform that ingests documents from any source, intelligently processes them into semantic chunks, and builds a queryable graph of entities and relationships - all while maintaining complete traceability back to source materials.

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Clone-Before-Modify Pattern** - Every graph modification happens in a safe clone first, with visual impact assessment before committing changes. No other platform offers this safety-first approach.

2. **Visual Ontology Designer** - Business users can define custom entity types and relationships using Pydantic-based schemas through an intuitive visual interface, not code.

3. **Intelligent Chunking with Context Preservation** - Our algorithm respects the 10K character limit while maintaining semantic boundaries, using overlapping strategies and AI assistance to ensure no context is lost.

4. **Complete Audit Trail** - Every piece of knowledge links back to its source document, page, and position, satisfying compliance requirements competitors ignore.

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**

- **Built on Proven Patterns**: Leverages Anthropic's contextual retrieval methodology, already validated at scale
- **API-First Design**: Respects real-world constraints (rate limits, character limits) that academic solutions ignore  
- **Pragmatic Architecture**: Uses existing Airtable infrastructure for rapid deployment while maintaining flexibility for future migrations
- **User-Centric Workflow**: Command palette (Cmd+K) and keyboard navigation for power users who process hundreds of documents daily

**High-Level Vision:** Transform every organization's document chaos into a living knowledge graph that learns, grows, and delivers insights at the speed of thought - making institutional knowledge as accessible as a Google search, but with the depth and traceability of a research library.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Limited to $5,000 for initial infrastructure and third-party services. Development effort constrained to single developer resource. Must use free/low-cost tiers where possible (Airtable free tier initially)
- **Timeline:** MVP must be delivered within 12 weeks (Q1 2025). Beta testing with 5 users by end of Q1 2025. Production-ready version by Q2 2025
- **Resources:** Single full-stack developer for initial build. No dedicated DevOps or QA resources. Limited access to domain experts for ontology design validation
- **Technical:** Airtable 5 requests/second rate limit is hard constraint. Zep's 10,000 character limit for chunks is non-negotiable. Docling accuracy limitations for complex PDF layouts. Browser-based graph visualization performance limits at 5000+ nodes

### Key Assumptions

- Airtable's free/team tier will support initial data volume and complexity requirements
- Organizations have relatively clean PDF documents (not scanned images requiring OCR)
- Users are willing to review and adjust auto-generated chunks before committing to production
- Knowledge graphs under 10,000 nodes will cover 80% of use cases
- OpenAI API costs will remain stable and within budget for smart chunking assistance
- Target organizations already have some form of document repository to migrate from
- Beta users will provide sufficient feedback to validate core assumptions
- The clone-before-modify pattern won't create excessive storage overhead in Airtable
- Sequential document processing is acceptable for MVP user workflows
- Modern browsers' JavaScript engines can handle D3.js rendering of 1000+ nodes efficiently

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Airtable Scalability:** Free tier may hit limits faster than expected with clone-before-modify pattern creating duplicate records. Impact: Could force paid tier earlier, adding $20-45/month/user cost
- **Docling Accuracy:** PDF conversion may fail on complex layouts, scanned documents, or non-standard formats. Impact: Manual intervention required, reducing throughput below target 50 docs/hour
- **Single Developer Bottleneck:** All knowledge concentrated in one person creates bus factor risk. Impact: Development could halt if developer unavailable, no redundancy for critical fixes
- **Graph Visualization Performance:** D3.js may struggle with complex graphs earlier than 1000 node threshold. Impact: Poor UX could drive user abandonment, require WebGL rewrite
- **API Cost Overruns:** OpenAI API usage for smart chunking could exceed budget with heavy usage. Impact: May need to limit AI features or pass costs to users
- **Integration Complexity:** Airtable's API limitations may prevent certain operations or require workarounds. Impact: Features may take 2-3x longer to implement than estimated
- **Market Timing:** Competitors may release similar solutions during our development period. Impact: Loss of first-mover advantage, need for feature differentiation

### Open Questions

- What is the optimal chunk overlap percentage for maintaining context while minimizing redundancy?
- How should the system handle versioning when source documents are updated?
- Can Airtable's linked records efficiently support the complex graph relationships we need?
- What's the best approach for handling multi-language documents?
- Should we build our own PDF processing or rely entirely on Docling?
- How do we handle security for documents containing PII or confidential information?
- What's the right pricing model - per user, per document, or per graph?
- How do we validate ontology quality without domain experts?
- Should we support custom LLMs beyond OpenAI for chunk processing?

### PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for Krypton Graph. The system addresses the critical challenge of knowledge fragmentation by transforming disparate documents into a unified, queryable knowledge graph with complete traceability. The unique clone-before-modify pattern and visual ontology design differentiate us in the market.

The PRD has already been created at `docs/prd.md` with comprehensive requirements across 5 epics and 26 user stories. The technical architecture emphasizes pragmatic choices (React/TypeScript/Airtable) suitable for single-developer implementation within 12-week timeline constraints.

Key success factors include achieving 50+ docs/hour processing, maintaining >98% success rate, and delivering the clone-before-modify safety pattern that competitors lack. Beta testing with 5 users in Q1 2025 will validate our core assumptions before scaling.
