## Technical Debt & Risks

### Technical Debt Items
1. Migrate from Airtable to PostgreSQL (future)
2. Implement caching layer for search
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Optimize graph rendering for 100k+ nodes
5. Implement data versioning

### Key Risks
1. **ZEP API Rate Limits** - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, batch operations
2. **Airtable Scale Limits** - Mitigation: Plan PostgreSQL migration path
3. **Graph Performance** - Mitigation: WebGL rendering, virtualization
4. **Data Consistency** - Mitigation: Transaction-like operations, audit trail
