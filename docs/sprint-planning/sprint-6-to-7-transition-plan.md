# Sprint 6 to Sprint 7 Transition Plan

**Document Date**: September 7, 2025  
**Transition Period**: End of Sprint 6 → Start of Sprint 7

## Technical Handoff Requirements

### From Sprint 6 Team to Sprint 7 Team

#### Code Artifacts
```
MUST REVIEW:
├── /src/services/zep-v3/        # Zep integration patterns
├── /src/services/ontology/      # Current ontology management
├── /src/api/graph/              # Graph API endpoints
└── /docs/architecture/          # System architecture docs

NEW FOR SPRINT 7:
├── /src/services/document/      # Document processing (new)
├── /src/services/ai/            # AI analysis engine (new)
├── /src/components/upload/      # Upload UI components (new)
└── /src/utils/typeGeneration/   # Type suggestion logic (new)
```

#### Key Integration Points

| Component | Sprint 6 State | Sprint 7 Requirements |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Zep API** | Basic CRUD complete | Add classification metrics |
| **Ontology Store** | Manual creation only | Add AI-suggested types |
| **Document Service** | Simple upload | Multi-format processing |
| **UI Framework** | shadcn/ui integrated | Add progress components |
| **WebSockets** | Basic events | Real-time progress updates |

---

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Team Composition for Sprint 7

**Core Development Team**
- **Lead Developer**: Focus on document analysis service
- **Frontend Developer**: Build upload and progress UI
- **Full-Stack Developer**: OpenAI integration and type suggestions

**Support Resources**
- **DevOps**: Set up document processing infrastructure
- **QA**: Prepare test document sets
- **UX (Sally)**: Finalize UI designs by Day 3

### Skill Requirements
- OpenAI API experience (critical)
- Document parsing libraries (important)
- WebSocket implementation (important)
- Progress tracking UX (helpful)

## Risk Management During Transition

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Sprint 6 delays affect Sprint 7 start | High | Identify core vs. nice-to-have in Sprint 6 | Bob |
| OpenAI API not ready | Critical | Test API access by Day 4 | DevOps |
| Document parsing complexity | Medium | Spike on Day 4-5 | Tech Lead |
| Team knowledge gaps | Medium | Knowledge transfer on Day 3 | John |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Parallel Track Option**
   - If Sprint 6 extends, run Sprint 7 prep in parallel
   - Dedicate one developer to Sprint 7 setup

2. **Fallback Plan**
   - If OpenAI issues, start with simple pattern matching
   - Build modular to swap AI providers if needed

3. **Progressive Rollout**
   - Keep manual ontology creation as fallback
   - Feature flag for document-driven flow

---

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Communications
