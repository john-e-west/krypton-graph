## Executive Summary
All sprint planning deliverables have been completed for the ZEP Knowledge Graph v3 integration. Stories have been refined, blockers addressed, and Sprint 4 is ready to begin Monday morning.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Story Refinements ✅

#### Sprint 4 Stories (Ready for Monday)
- **Story 5.1: ZEP Client Integration** - 5 points (reduced scope)
  - Broken into 7 tasks (avg 3h each)
  - Clear technical specifications
  - Dependencies identified
  
- **Story 8.1: Clerk-ZEP User Integration** - 5 points
  - Broken into 7 tasks (avg 2.5h each)
  - Webhook implementation detailed
  - Testing approach defined

- **Story 2.3: Document Chunking** - 3 points (BLOCKER)
  - Must complete by Wednesday
  - Dev 1 dedicated first 3 days
  - Clear handoff plan

#### Sprint 5 Stories (Split & Refined)
- **Story 5.2a: Chunk-to-ZEP Sync Engine** - 8 points
  - Focus on sync mechanics
  - 6 detailed tasks
  
- **Story 5.2b: Embedding Generation** - 5 points  
  - Separate embedding pipeline
  - Performance optimized

#### Sprint 6 Stories (MVP Scope)
- **Story 6.1: ZEP Semantic Search** - 8 points
  - Natural language processing
  - <200ms response time target
  
- **Story 7.1: D3.js Graph Viewer (MVP)** - 5 points
  - Reduced to 1,000 nodes for MVP
  - Basic visualization features

### 2. Blocker Resolution ✅

**Epic 2 Story 2.3 Mitigation:**
- Strategy: Front-load completion (Days 1-3 of Sprint 4)
- Dev 1 dedicated to blocker resolution
- Clear success criteria defined
- Fallback plans documented

### 3. Overlap Resolution ✅

**Epic 4 vs Epic 7 Visualization:**
- Decision: Cancel Epic 4 Story 4.4
- Rationale: Avoid duplicate effort
- Savings: 13 story points
- All features consolidated in Epic 7

### 4. Sprint Backlogs ✅

| Sprint | Points | Key Deliverables | Risk Level |
|--------|--------|------------------|------------|
| Sprint 4 | 13 | ZEP & Clerk integration foundation | HIGH (blocker) |
| Sprint 5 | 13 | Document sync & embeddings | MEDIUM |
| Sprint 6 | 13 | Search & visualization MVP | LOW |

### 5. Task Boards ✅

**Sprint 4 Task Board:**
- Day-by-day assignments for both developers
- QA activities scheduled
- Blocker resolution prioritized
- Clear handoff points

### 6. Risk Management ✅

**Top Risks Identified:**
1. Story 2.3 delay (HIGH) → Daily monitoring
2. ZEP rate limits (MEDIUM) → Start at 50% capacity
3. Search latency (MEDIUM) → Aggressive caching

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Story 5.2 Split** → Two 5-8 point stories instead of one 13-pointer
2. **Epic 2 Acceleration** → Complete blocker in first 3 days
3. **Visualization Consolidation** → Single implementation in Epic 7
4. **MVP Scope Reduction** → 1,000 nodes instead of 10,000
