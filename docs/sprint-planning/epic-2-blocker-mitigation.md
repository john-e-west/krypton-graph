# Epic 2 Blocker Mitigation Strategy

## Critical Issue
**Story 2.3 (Document Chunking)** must be completed before Sprint 5's Story 5.2 (Document-to-ZEP Sync) can begin.

## Current Status
- Epic 2 Story 2.3: IN PROGRESS - Blocking Sprint 5
- Dependency: Story 5.2 requires completed chunks in Airtable to sync to ZEP
- Risk: Sprint 5 cannot start key integration work without resolution

## Recommended Mitigation: Option A (Accelerated Completion)

### Strategy: Front-load Story 2.3 Completion
**Timeline:** First 3 days of Sprint 4 (Week 7, Monday-Wednesday)

#### Resource Allocation
- **Dev 1:** Focus 100% on Story 2.3 completion (Days 1-3)
- **Dev 2:** Start Story 8.1 (Clerk-ZEP Integration) independently
- **Dev 1:** Switch to Story 5.1 after 2.3 complete (Days 4-10)

#### Implementation Plan

**Monday (Day 1):**
- Dev 1: Complete core chunking algorithm
- Dev 1: Implement chunk size optimization
- Dev 2: Begin Clerk webhook setup

**Tuesday (Day 2):**
- Dev 1: Add metadata preservation
- Dev 1: Implement Airtable storage
- Dev 2: Continue user mapping work

**Wednesday (Day 3):**
- Dev 1: Complete testing & validation
- Dev 1: Deploy to staging
- Dev 1: Handoff documentation
- Dev 2: Profile sync implementation

**Thursday-Friday Week 1:**
- Dev 1: Begin Story 5.1 (ZEP Client)
- Dev 2: Continue Story 8.1
- Both: Normal sprint velocity

#### Success Criteria for Story 2.3
- [ ] Smart chunking algorithm operational
- [ ] Chunks stored in Airtable with metadata
- [ ] 95% chunk quality score
- [ ] Processing 10+ documents successfully
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Alternative Options (Not Recommended)

#### Option B: Defer Story 5.2
- **Impact:** Delays ZEP integration by 2 weeks
- **Risk:** Cascading delays to MVP
- **Not Recommended:** Creates timeline pressure

#### Option C: Stub Implementation
- **Approach:** Create mock chunking for testing
- **Risk:** Technical debt, rework required
- **Not Recommended:** Doubles implementation effort

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Story 2.3 takes longer than 3 days**
   - Mitigation: Daily check-ins, scope reduction if needed
   - Fallback: Reduce chunk optimization, deliver MVP chunking

2. **Quality issues with rushed implementation**
   - Mitigation: Dedicated QA review on Day 3
   - Fallback: Bug fixes in parallel with Sprint 4 work

3. **Dev 1 burnout from compressed timeline**
   - Mitigation: No overtime, clear scope boundaries
   - Fallback: Dev 2 assists if needed

### Monitoring Plan
- Daily standup focus on 2.3 progress
- Blocker escalation within 4 hours
- Wednesday checkpoint: Go/No-Go decision
- Thursday: Confirm Sprint 5 readiness

## Sprint 4 Adjusted Capacity

### Original Plan (13 points)
- Story 5.1: 8 points (Dev 1)
- Story 8.1: 5 points (Dev 2)

### Adjusted Plan (13 points maintained)
- Story 2.3: 3 points (Dev 1, Days 1-3)
- Story 5.1: 5 points (Dev 1, Days 4-10, reduced scope)
- Story 8.1: 5 points (Dev 2, full sprint)

### Scope Adjustments for Story 5.1
**Defer to Sprint 5:**
- Advanced monitoring features
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced error recovery

**Keep in Sprint 4:**
- Core client implementation
- Basic rate limiting
- User mapping
- Essential error handling

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Monday AM:** Inform PM of plan execution
- **Wednesday PM:** Go/No-Go decision communicated
- **Friday:** Sprint 5 readiness confirmation

### Team Coordination
- **Dev 1 & Dev 2:** Daily sync at 9:15 AM
- **QA:** Prioritize 2.3 testing Wednesday
- **PM:** Wednesday checkpoint meeting

## Success Metrics

### Sprint 4 Success
- Story 2.3: 100% complete by Wednesday
- Story 5.1: Core functionality delivered
- Story 8.1: On track for completion
- Sprint velocity: 13 points achieved

### Blocker Resolution Success
- Chunking operational by Day 3
- No Sprint 5 delays
- Quality standards maintained
- Team morale preserved

## Decision Required

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Option A (Accelerated Completion)

**Approval Needed By:** Monday 9 AM Sprint Planning

**Decision Maker:** Product Manager (John)
