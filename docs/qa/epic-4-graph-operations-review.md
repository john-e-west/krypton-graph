## Epic-Level Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Clone-Before-Modify (4.2)**: Data integrity feature without tests
2. **Accept/Reject Workflow (4.5)**: Change management without E2E validation
3. **Airtable Integration**: No integration tests across all stories

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Graph Management (4.1)**: Core CRUD operations untested
2. **Impact Assessment (4.3)**: Complex algorithms without validation
3. **Query Interface (4.6)**: Query parsing logic untested

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **Graph Explorer (4.4)**: Visualization feature, non-critical

   - E2E test for clone-modify-accept flow

2. **Story 4.5 Tests** (Accept/Reject Workflow)
   - Unit tests for comparison logic
   - Integration tests for state transitions
   - E2E test for complete workflow

3. **Airtable Integration Suite**
   - GraphService CRUD operations
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Connection failure scenarios

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Sprint 4, Week 2)
**Priority: P1 - Should Have**

1. **Story 4.1 Tests** (Graph Management)
   - ActiveGraphContext state management
   - Archive/restore operations
   - Export functionality

2. **Story 4.3 Tests** (Impact Assessment)
   - Ripple effect calculations
   - Performance with large graphs
   - Edge case handling

3. **Story 4.6 Tests** (Query Interface)
   - Query parsing logic
   - Result formatting
   - Natural language processing

### Phase 3: UI and Visual Testing (Sprint 5)
**Priority: P2 - Nice to Have**

1. **Story 4.4 Tests** (Graph Explorer)
   - D3.js rendering
   - Interaction handlers
   - Visual regression tests

2. **Cross-Story Integration**
   - End-to-end user journeys
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Load testing

## Compliance Assessment

### Architecture Standards
- ✅ **Component Structure**: Well-organized, follows patterns
- ✅ **TypeScript Usage**: Strong typing throughout
- ✅ **State Management**: Proper context and service patterns

## Recommendations

### For Development Team
1. **Immediate**: Stop new feature development, focus on test implementation
2. **Use TDD**: Write tests first for any bug fixes or changes
3. **Pair Programming**: Pair on test implementation to share knowledge

### For Product Management
1. **Adjust Sprint Scope**: Allocate 40% of Sprint 4 to test implementation
2. **Define Success Metrics**: Set minimum test coverage requirements
3. **Risk Acceptance**: Document accepted risks if tests are deferred

### For Scrum Master
1. **Daily Focus**: Track test implementation progress daily
2. **Impediment Removal**: Ensure test environment is properly configured
3. **Sprint Planning**: Include test tasks in Sprint 5 planning

## Conclusion

**UPDATE 2025-01-08**: Epic 4 shows significant progress with 2 of 6 stories achieving PASS status through comprehensive testing and QA gap remediation.
