- WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates
- Email notification templates

### Story 8.5: Collaborative Annotations
**Priority:** P2 (Nice to Have)  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Implemented  

**Test Results:**
- ‚ùå No comment system on graph elements
- ‚ùå No annotation UI

## Integration Points Assessment

### Current State:
- **Clerk Authentication:** Package installed but not configured
- **ZEP Integration:** Not started
- **Airtable Integration:** Ready for user data storage

### Integration Summary Screenshot:

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:
1. **Clerk-ZEP Synchronization** - Critical for unified authentication
2. **Permission System** - Essential for data security
3. **API Rate Limiting** - Required for system stability

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **Activity Feed Performance** - Real-time updates may impact performance
2. **Workspace Isolation** - Data separation between workspaces

### Low Risk Items:
1. **Collaborative Annotations** - Nice-to-have feature
2. **Email Digests** - Can be implemented incrementally

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0):
1. Complete Clerk authentication setup
2. Implement basic user profile management
3. Create ZEP user synchronization middleware

### Short-term Actions (P1):
1. Design and implement RBAC system
2. Create permission middleware
3. Add API key management

### Long-term Actions (P2):
1. Build team workspace functionality
2. Implement activity feed
3. Add collaborative annotations

## Conclusion

Epic 8 represents a significant enhancement to the Krypton Graph platform, adding essential collaboration and user management features. While the foundation (Clerk) is in place, substantial development work is required to fully implement the user stories. Priority should be given to completing the Clerk-ZEP integration and implementing the permission management system, as these are critical for platform security and functionality.

The mock UIs created during testing provide visual guidance for the development team on the expected features and user experience.

## Next Steps

1. **Development Team:** Begin with Clerk configuration and ZEP user sync
2. **Product Team:** Prioritize workspace features based on user feedback
3. **QA Team:** Prepare integration test scenarios for user management
4. **DevOps Team:** Set up monitoring for authentication services
