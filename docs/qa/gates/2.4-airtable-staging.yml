# Additional Review Notes  
# ========================
# Exceptional Implementation Quality:
# - Comprehensive AirtableStagingService (500+ lines) with all 7 acceptance criteria
# - Professional episode management with complete lifecycle tracking
# - Transaction-like behavior with systematic record tracking for rollback
# - Robust verification system with 5 different validation checks
# - Full audit logging for CRUD operations with before/after values
# - 22 tests passing (100% success rate) with comprehensive coverage
# - Complete Airtable infrastructure:
#   * AirtableClient with rate limiting and retry logic
#   * RateLimiter with exponential backoff
#   * Comprehensive type system for all 13 database tables
#   * Multiple service modules (staging, base, entity, edge, ontology)
#
# Technical Excellence:
# - Episode-based transactions with proper status management
# - Rollback mechanism with reverse-order cleanup and orphan prevention
# - Referential integrity validation with configurable rules
# - Rate limiting respects Airtable's 5 requests/second limit
# - Proper error handling with retries and graceful degradation
# - UUID generation for episodes and audit logs
# - Batch processing for efficient record operations
#
# This is a production-ready implementation demonstrating enterprise-level software practices
