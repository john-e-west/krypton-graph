# Additional notes  
notes: |
  Story 5.2 is in "Reviewed - Ready for Development" status but shows no 
  implementation progress. All 6 tasks remain unchecked with no Dev Agent Record.
  
  This is a critical integration story that bridges document chunking (2.3)
  and ZEP client (5.1) capabilities. The architecture is well-documented with:
  - Clear sync strategy (batch size 20, concurrency 5)
  - Defined performance requirements (100 chunks < 5 min)
  - Comprehensive error handling approach
  - Proper dependency identification
  
  However, without any implementation, this represents a significant gap in
  the system integration. The story cannot proceed to any quality assessment
  beyond architectural review until development begins.
  
  Dependencies check required:
  - Story 2.3: Smart Chunking Engine (shows PASS gate)  
  - Story 5.1: ZEP Client Integration (shows CLEARED gate)
  
  Both dependencies appear complete, so implementation can begin.
