# Additional notes
notes: |
  Story shows solid technical implementation with comprehensive error handling,
  rate limiting, and monitoring. However, Definition of Done items remain incomplete:
  - Documentation (7th checkbox) not done
  - Code review (8th checkbox) not done  
  - Staging deployment (9th checkbox) not done
  
  Architecture follows best practices with service layer abstraction and proper
  testing structure. Dev agent successfully implemented complex integration with
  thoughtful design decisions (starting at 50% rate limit, circuit breaker pattern).
