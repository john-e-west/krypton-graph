# Additional Review Notes  
# ========================
# Exceptional Architecture:
# - Comprehensive service layer with all 7 acceptance criteria features
# - Excellent modular design: chunkingService, boundaryDetection, overlapStrategy, 
#   smartBoundaries, metadataGenerator, chunkAdjustments
# - Rich UI components with tabbed interface (ChunkPreview, ChunkBoundaryEditor)
# - Professional OpenAI integration with proper fallback mechanisms
# - 51 test cases covering edge cases and core functionality
#
# Critical Issues Preventing Production:
# - 25 of 51 tests failing (49% failure rate)
# - Core chunk size validation not enforcing 10K limit
# - Service API returns object but tests expect array
# - Metadata undefined property access crashes
# - Boundary detection regex patterns broken
# - Overlap calculation edge case failures
#
# Architecture Quality: EXCELLENT
# Implementation Quality: POOR (due to bugs)
# Test Coverage: COMPREHENSIVE (but broken)
#
# Recommendation: Fix implementation bugs - architecture is production-ready
