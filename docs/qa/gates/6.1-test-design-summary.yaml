  high_risk_areas:
    - security: "SQL injection, API key handling"
    - performance: "200ms p95 SLA, concurrent load"
    - integration: "ZEP API availability, rate limiting"
    - data_quality: "Result relevance, deduplication"
    
  test_recommendations:
    - "Execute P0 security tests first for fail-fast on vulnerabilities"
    - "Validate ZEP integration early to identify dependency issues"
    - "Run performance tests under realistic load conditions"
    - "Use test containers for Redis cache in integration tests"
    - "Implement retry logic for E2E tests to handle flakiness"
