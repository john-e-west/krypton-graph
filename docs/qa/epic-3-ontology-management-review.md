- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- <500ms response for large ontologies
- Clear error messages for all validation failures

## Conclusion

Epic 3 demonstrates strong execution with comprehensive ontology management features. The visual builders for entity and edge types are particularly well-designed, making complex schema definition accessible. While security and algorithm improvements are needed, the epic delivers significant business value and enables the knowledge graph foundation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Complete feature implementation
