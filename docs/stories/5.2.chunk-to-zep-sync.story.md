## Story
**As a** system

  - [ ] Measure sync performance

## Dev Notes

### Sync Architecture
[Source: docs/zep-integration-architecture.md]

**Sync Strategy:**
- Batch size: 20 chunks maximum
- Concurrency: 5 parallel syncs
- Rate limit: 30 req/min (safety margin)
- Retry: 3 attempts with backoff

**Data Flow:**
1. Fetch unsynced chunks from Airtable
2. Group chunks by document_id
3. Create/retrieve ZEP episode
4. Upload chunks to episode
5. Update sync status in Airtable
6. Handle failures gracefully

### Airtable Schema Updates
```
Table: Chunks
Additional fields needed:
- sync_status (select: pending, syncing, synced, failed)
- sync_attempt_count (number)
- last_sync_attempt (datetime)
- last_sync_error (long text)
- zep_episode_id (text)
- zep_chunk_id (text)
```

### ZEP Episode Structure
```typescript
interface Episode {
  episode_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  metadata: {
    document_id: string;
    document_title: string;
    source_type: string;
    created_at: string;
    chunk_count: number;
  };
  chunks: ChunkReference[];
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Sync 100 chunks in < 5 minutes
- Handle documents up to 500 chunks
- Maintain < 1% failure rate
- Support concurrent document processing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Sync service operational
- [ ] Episode management working
- [ ] Metadata preserved accurately
- [ ] Error recovery tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
