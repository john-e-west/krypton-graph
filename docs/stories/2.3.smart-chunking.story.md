## Dev Notes

### Chunking Service Architecture
```typescript
// src/lib/chunking/chunkingService.ts
interface ChunkingConfig {
  maxChunkSize: 10000          // characters including metadata
  minChunkSize: 500            // minimum viable chunk
  overlapPercentage: 15         // 10-20% configurable
  useSmartBoundaries: boolean   // OpenAI enhancement
  preserveStructure: boolean    // keep sections intact
  metadataOverhead: 500        // reserved for metadata
}

interface DocumentChunk {
  id: string
  documentId: string
  content: string
  index: number
  startChar: number
  endChar: number
  overlapStart?: number
  overlapEnd?: number
  metadata: {
    wordCount: number
    charCount: number
    headings: string[]
    summary?: string
    previousChunkId?: string
    nextChunkId?: string
  }
}
```

### Natural Boundary Detection
```typescript
const BOUNDARY_MARKERS = {
  section: /^#{1,6}\s/m,        // Markdown headings
  paragraph: /\n\n/,             // Double newline
  sentence: /[.!?]\s+/,         // Sentence endings
  codeBlock: /```[\s\S]*?```/,  // Code blocks (keep intact)
  table: /\|.*\|[\s\S]*?\n\n/,  // Markdown tables
  list: /^[\s]*[-*+\d.]\s/m     // List items
}

function findNaturalBoundary(text: string, targetPosition: number): number {
  // Priority: section > paragraph > sentence
  // Never break code blocks or tables
}
```

### Overlap Calculation
```typescript
function calculateOverlap(
  chunk: string, 
  nextChunk: string, 
  overlapPercent: number
): {
  overlapText: string
  overlapSize: number
} {
  const overlapSize = Math.floor(chunk.length * (overlapPercent / 100))
  const overlapStart = chunk.length - overlapSize
  const overlapEnd = Math.min(overlapSize, nextChunk.length)
  
  return {
    overlapText: chunk.substring(overlapStart) + nextChunk.substring(0, overlapEnd),
    overlapSize: overlapStart + overlapEnd
  }
}
```

### OpenAI Integration
```typescript
const SMART_CHUNKING_PROMPT = `
Given the following document text, identify the best points to split it into chunks 
of approximately 8000-9000 characters each, while:
1. Preserving semantic coherence
2. Not breaking in the middle of important concepts
3. Keeping related information together
4. Respecting section boundaries when possible

Return chunk boundaries as character positions.

Document:
{documentText}
`

async function getSmartBoundaries(text: string): Promise<number[]> {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: SMART_CHUNKING_PROMPT.replace('{documentText}', text) }],
    temperature: 0.3
  })
  
  return parseBoundaries(response.choices[0].message.content)
}
```

### Chunk Preview Component
```tsx
interface ChunkPreviewProps {
  chunks: DocumentChunk[]
  onAdjust: (chunkId: string, newBoundary: number) => void
  onMerge: (chunk1Id: string, chunk2Id: string) => void
  onSplit: (chunkId: string, position: number) => void
}

// Visual representation:
// [Chunk 1: 8,543 chars] [overlap: 1,200] [Chunk 2: 7,892 chars]
//           ↑ Draggable boundary
```

### Metadata Structure
```typescript
interface ChunkMetadata {
  // Position metadata
  documentId: string
  chunkIndex: number
  totalChunks: number
  startPosition: number
  endPosition: number
  
  // Content metadata
  wordCount: number
  characterCount: number
  sentenceCount: number
  paragraphCount: number
  
  // Structural metadata
  headings: Array<{level: number, text: string}>
  hasCodeBlocks: boolean
  hasTables: boolean
  hasLists: boolean
  
  // Semantic metadata (from OpenAI)
  summary?: string
  topics?: string[]
  entities?: string[]
  
  // Navigation
  previousChunkId?: string
  nextChunkId?: string
  overlapWithPrevious?: number
  overlapWithNext?: number
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Process documents in queue (max 5 concurrent)
- Cache OpenAI responses for similar content
- Use Web Workers for large document processing
- Stream chunks to UI as they're created

### Testing Standards
- Test various document sizes (1KB to 10MB)
- Verify chunk size limits are respected
- Test overlap consistency
- Validate metadata accuracy
- Test manual adjustment features
- Benchmark processing speed

3. **Enhancement**: Expand test coverage for edge cases

### Updated Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment  

**Implementation Quality: GOOD** (with significant issues)
- Comprehensive service layer implementation with all core features
- Excellent architecture with clean separation of concerns
- OpenAI integration for smart boundaries implemented properly
- Rich UI components with tabbed interface and boundary editing
- **However**: Major test failures (25 of 51 tests failing) indicate implementation bugs

### Code Analysis Results

**Service Architecture Quality**:
- ✅ Excellent modular design with clean interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Proper configuration management and options handling
- ✅ Smart boundary detection with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Professional error handling and graceful degradation

**Core Algorithm Implementation**:
- ✅ Boundary detection with natural break prioritization
- ✅ Configurable overlap strategy (10-20%)
- ✅ Code block and table preservation logic
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Chunk size validation failing (chunks exceeding 10K limit)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Metadata generation bugs causing test failures

**OpenAI Integration Quality**:
- ✅ Proper API client setup with fallback to rule-based chunking
- ✅ Well-designed prompts for semantic boundary detection
- ✅ Appropriate error handling for API failures
- ✅ Response parsing with validation
- ✅ Token usage optimization with text truncation

- ✅ Draggable boundary editor functionality
- ✅ Rich metadata display (headings, code, tables, lists)
- ✅ Manual split/merge operations
- ✅ Overlap percentage controls with real-time updates

### Critical Test Failures Analysis

**Major Issues Found (49% test failure rate)**:
1. **Chunk Size Validation**: Chunks exceeding 10K character limit (should be 9500 + 500 metadata)
2. **API Contract Mismatch**: Tests expect array response, service returns object with `.chunks` property
3. **Metadata Generation**: Undefined properties causing crashes
4. **Boundary Detection**: List detection regex not matching test cases
5. **Overlap Calculation**: Edge cases causing undefined properties

### Security and Performance

**Security Assessment**:
- ✅ Safe handling of user input in chunking algorithms
- ✅ OpenAI API key properly configured with environment variables
- ⚠️ Browser-based OpenAI API usage (development only - not production safe)

**Performance Assessment**:
- ✅ Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- ✅ Efficient boundary detection algorithms
- ✅ Batch processing capabilities
- ✅ Proper memory management in large document handling

### Refactoring Performed During Review

None - too many implementation bugs need developer attention first.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✅ Excellent TypeScript code organization
- Project Structure: ✅ Well-organized modular architecture
- Testing Strategy: ❌ Major test failures indicate broken functionality
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ Core functionality present but buggy implementation

### Files Modified During Review

None - implementation bugs require developer intervention

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.3-smart-chunking.yml

### Recommended Status

❌ Changes Required - Critical bugs must be fixed:
1. Fix chunk size validation (max 10K enforcement)
2. Resolve API contract mismatch in test responses
3. Debug metadata generation undefined property issues  
4. Fix boundary detection regex patterns
5. Address overlap calculation edge cases

**Note**: Architecture and feature completeness are excellent, but implementation bugs prevent production readiness. With bug fixes, this would be a high-quality implementation.
