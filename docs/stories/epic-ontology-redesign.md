# Document-Driven Ontology System - Master Epic

## Epic Title
Document-Driven Ontology Transformation - Paradigm Shift from Manual to Intelligent Discovery

## Epic Goal
Transform the Krypton Graph ontology creation from a manual, expert-driven process to an intelligent, document-driven discovery system that reduces time-to-value by 90% and increases classification success to 95%+, making knowledge graph technology accessible to non-technical users.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Functionality:**
- Manual ontology creation requiring KG expertise
- Static type definition before document processing
- Limited classification success (60-70%)
- No ontology reuse capabilities
- Complex user workflow requiring 1-2 hours setup

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4
- Graph Database: Zep v3 API
- Data Storage: Airtable
- UI Components: shadcn/ui v4

**Integration Points:**
- Zep v3 Graph API for entity/edge management
- OpenAI API for document analysis
- Airtable API for data persistence
- Existing authentication/authorization system

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added/Changed:**
- New document-first workflow replacing manual ontology creation
- AI-powered type suggestion engine
- Real-time classification preview and metrics
- Ontology library for pattern reuse
- Iterative type optimization based on unclassified items
- Visual type management with 10-type limit indicators

**How It Integrates:**
- Leverages existing document upload infrastructure
- Extends current Zep v3 integration with new classification endpoints
- Enhances existing UI with new document analysis components
- Maintains backward compatibility with manually created ontologies
- Preserves all existing knowledge graphs and data

**Success Criteria:**
- Time to first KG: <10 minutes (90% reduction)
- Classification success rate: >95%
- Ontology reuse rate: >60%
- Zero regression in existing functionality
- User satisfaction score: >8/10

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain functional with deprecation notices
- [x] Database schema changes are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow established design system (shadcn/ui)
- [x] Performance impact <100ms for existing operations
- [x] All existing knowledge graphs remain accessible
- [x] Manual ontology creation path preserved as fallback

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks

**1. AI Classification Accuracy**
- Risk: May not achieve 95% for all domains
- Mitigation: Implement confidence scoring, fallback to semi-manual process, collect training data
- Rollback: Preserve manual ontology creation path

**2. Zep API Constraints**
- Risk: 10-type limit may be insufficient for complex domains
- Mitigation: Type merging tools, hierarchical type suggestions, domain-specific templates
- Rollback: Allow manual type curation

**3. Performance at Scale**
- Risk: Large documents may cause timeouts
- Mitigation: Document chunking, background processing, progress indicators
- Rollback: Size limits with clear user messaging

**4. OpenAI API Dependency**
- Risk: Service outages or rate limits
- Mitigation: Caching, queue management, fallback to cached patterns
- Rollback: Offline mode with pre-trained patterns

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- OpenAI API key and quota allocation

2. **Sprint 8 Focus**: Type management UX is critical for user trust
3. **Sprint 9 Integration**: Ontology matching requires careful database design
4. **Sprint 10 Quality**: Performance optimization affects entire user experience

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain service boundaries for future microservices migration
- Implement comprehensive logging for AI decision tracking
- Design for horizontal scaling from day one
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout

### Testing Strategy
- Each sprint requires dedicated QA resources
- AI classification needs domain-specific test sets
