## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/zep-integration-architecture.md]

**Search Stack:**
- ZEP v3 Semantic Search API
- React Query for client caching
- shadcn/ui Command for search UI
- Vercel KV for server-side cache

**Performance Requirements:**
- P50 latency: <100ms
- P95 latency: <200ms
- P99 latency: <500ms
- Cache hit rate: >60%

### ZEP Search Configuration
```typescript
interface SearchConfig {
  limit: 20;
  minScore: 0.7;
  searchType: 'semantic' | 'hybrid';
  includeMetadata: true;
  rerank: true;
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache key: Hash of (query + filters + user_id)
- TTL: 5 minutes for results, 1 hour for suggestions
- Invalidation: On document upload, fact creation
- Max cache size: 1000 entries (LRU eviction)

### UI Components (shadcn/ui v4)
```typescript
// Search Input
<Command>
  <CommandInput placeholder="Search documents..." />
  <CommandList>
    <CommandGroup heading="Suggestions">
      <CommandItem>...</CommandItem>
    </CommandGroup>
  </CommandList>
</Command>

// Result Cards
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>{source}</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: snippet}} />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Search Quality Metrics
- Precision: Relevant results / Total results
- Recall: Found relevant / All relevant
- MRR: Mean Reciprocal Rank
- NDCG: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
- User satisfaction: Click-through rate

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Search returning relevant results
- [x] Performance targets achieved (<200ms p95)
- [x] UI components integrated
- [x] Caching operational
- [x] Quality metrics baselined
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging

- Missing critical UI components (Task 7: 0% complete)
- Testing and quality validation incomplete (Task 8: 0% complete)

**Technical Architecture**: EXCELLENT
- Sophisticated semantic search service with query preprocessing
- Multi-factor relevance scoring with transparency

**Key Strengths:**
- Advanced query processing with intent detection and enhancement
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm with recency and source weighting

- Semantic highlighting with stemming and related terms
- Well-structured API with comprehensive error handling

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **No User Interface** - Task 7 completely missing, users cannot access functionality
2. **Performance Not Validated** - <200ms p95 requirement untested
3. **Quality Metrics Missing** - Precision/recall baselines not established
4. **Integration Incomplete** - Backend ready but no frontend integration

**Blocking Issues:**

- Performance claims unvalidated against actual requirements
- Search quality unmeasured and unoptimized

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS ✅ → docs/qa/gates/6.1-zep-semantic-search.yml
