## Dev Notes

### Project Structure (from architecture.md)
Based on the hybrid Next.js structure decision, create the following directories:
```
src/
├── app/           # Prepare for Next.js migration
├── components/    # React components
│   ├── ui/       # shadcn-ui components
│   └── layout/   # Layout components
├── lib/          # Shared libraries
│   ├── types/    # TypeScript definitions
│   └── utils/    # Utility functions
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
└── styles/       # Global styles
```

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **React**: 18.x with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: 5.x with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x for styling
- **shadcn-ui**: v4 for component library
- **Vite**: Latest version for build tooling
- **ESLint**: With @typescript-eslint parser
- **Prettier**: For code formatting

### Environment Variables Required
```
# Airtable Configuration
VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=

# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=

# App Configuration
VITE_APP_ENV=development|staging|production
VITE_API_URL=
```

### Testing Standards
- Test files co-located with components (*.test.tsx)
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Coverage threshold: 80%
