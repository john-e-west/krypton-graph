## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/zep-integration-architecture.md]

**Authentication Stack:**
- Clerk 5.0+ for authentication
- Clerk webhooks for user lifecycle events
- Svix for webhook signature verification
- JWT for session management

**User Mapping Strategy:**
- Primary key: Clerk user_id
- Store mapping in Airtable for persistence
- Cache in Vercel KV for performance
- Sync metadata bidirectionally

**Webhook Security:**
- Verify all webhook signatures
- Use webhook secret from environment
- Implement replay attack protection
- Log all webhook events

### Clerk Webhook Events
```typescript
// Event types to handle:
type ClerkWebhookEvent = 
  | 'user.created'
  | 'user.updated' 
  | 'user.deleted'
  | 'organizationMembership.created'
  | 'organizationMembership.updated'
```

### Airtable Schema
```
Table: UserMappings
- id (autonumber)
- clerk_user_id (text, unique)
- zep_user_id (text, unique)
- email (email)
- name (text)
- roles (multiselect)
- last_synced_at (datetime)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime)
- status (select: active, deleted, suspended)
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for this story
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxx
ZEP_API_KEY=xxx
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=xxx
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=xxx
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- All webhook handlers must return 200 OK quickly
- Process async in background
- Queue failures for retry
- Max 5 retries with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue after max retries

### Testing Standards
[Source: Testing requirements]
- Test files: `app/api/clerk/webhooks/__tests__/`
- Use MSW for mocking external APIs
- Test webhook signature verification
- Test idempotency of operations
- Minimum 80% code coverage

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Webhook endpoint deployed and verified
- [x] User creation flow tested E2E
- [x] Profile sync working bidirectionally
- [x] Permissions properly mapped
- [x] Account deletion cascading correctly
- [x] Monitoring dashboard available
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code reviewed and approved (2025-01-08)
