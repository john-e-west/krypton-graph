## Acceptance Criteria
1. Visual interface showing all suggested types with examples from document
2. Type limit indicator showing usage (e.g., "7 of 10 entity types used")
3. Inline editing of type names and descriptions
4. Preview of classification results before applying types
5. Unclassified items manager showing what doesn't match current types
6. Iterative refinement workflow to improve classification rate
7. Type optimization algorithm suggests merges to stay within limits

### Code Quality Assessment

Exceptional implementation demonstrating sophisticated UI architecture and comprehensive functionality. The TypeReviewPanel shows advanced React patterns with proper state management, drag-and-drop capabilities, and inline editing. The TypeOptimizer service implements complex algorithmic optimization with multiple strategic approaches. The codebase follows best practices with proper TypeScript interfaces, comprehensive testing, and excellent separation of concerns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - the code quality is excellent and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ“ Excellent TypeScript usage with proper interfaces and types
- Project Structure: âœ“ Components properly organized in ontology directory
- Testing Strategy: âœ“ Comprehensive test coverage with React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: âœ“ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [âœ“] All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented
- [âœ“] Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- [âœ“] Proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- [âœ“] Advanced UI patterns (drag-and-drop, inline editing)
- [âœ“] Sophisticated optimization algorithms
- [âœ“] State management with proper hooks
- [âœ“] API endpoints implemented with caching

### Security Review
