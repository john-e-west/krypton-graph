## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/zep-integration-architecture.md]

**Tech Stack:**
- ZEP Knowledge Graph v3 API (Cloud)
- TypeScript 5.3+
- Next.js API Routes 14.2+
- Clerk 5.0+ for authentication
- Airtable REST API v0 for staging
- Vercel Edge Functions for deployment

**Service Layer Pattern:**
- Abstract ZEP API behind service interfaces
- Enable mocking for tests
- Support future migration if needed

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Start at 30 req/min (50% of limit)
- Gradually increase to 60 req/min
- Monitor for 429 responses
- Implement adaptive rate limiting

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- All errors must be typed
- Log all errors to Axiom
- Return user-friendly messages
- Include request IDs for debugging

### ZEP API Configuration
```typescript
// Environment variables needed:
ZEP_API_KEY=<api_key>
ZEP_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
ZEP_BASE_URL=https://api.getzep.com/v3
```

### Airtable Schema Updates
Need to create/update tables:
- `Episodes`: id, zep_episode_id, document_id, user_id, created_at, status
- `UserMappings`: id, clerk_user_id, zep_user_id, created_at, updated_at

### Testing Standards
[Source: Testing requirements from architecture]
- Test files location: `packages/zep-client/src/__tests__/`
- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Mock external APIs
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests in `app/api/zep/__tests__/`

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] Rate limiting verified at 30 req/min
- [x] Error handling tested
- [x] Health endpoint responding
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
