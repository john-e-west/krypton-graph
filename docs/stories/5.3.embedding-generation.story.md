interface EmbeddingQuality {
  averageNorm: number;      // Should be ~1.0
  zeroVectorCount: number;  // Should be 0
  dimensionality: number;   // Must be 1536
  similarityScore: number;  // Average cosine similarity
}
```

### Airtable Schema
```
Table: Chunks
Additional fields:
- has_embedding (checkbox)
