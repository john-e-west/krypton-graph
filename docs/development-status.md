- Story 3.2: Entity Type Definition Editor
- Story 3.3: Edge Type Definition Builder
- Story 3.4: Test Dataset Creation
- Story 3.5: Ontology Code Generation and Export

### Epic 4: Knowledge Graph Operations (Not Started)

- Story 4.2: Clone-Before-Modify Implementation
- Story 4.3: Impact Assessment Engine
- Story 4.4: Graph Explorer with D3.js
- Story 4.5: Accept/Reject Workflow
- Story 4.6: Graph Query Interface

## Project Metrics

### Velocity Tracking
- **Epic 1:** 4 stories completed in 1 sprint
- **Epic 2:** 5 stories completed in 1 sprint
- **Average Velocity:** 4.5 stories per sprint
- **Projected Completion:** 4 more sprints needed (8 weeks)

### Quality Metrics
- **Gate Test Pass Rate:** 100% (5/5 gates passed)
- **Rework Required:** None reported
- **Technical Debt:** None identified

## Key Achievements
1. **Ahead of Schedule:** 2 epics complete in 2 weeks vs 12-week timeline
2. **Quality Standards Met:** All gate tests passing on first attempt
3. **Core Pipeline Working:** End-to-end document processing operational
4. **Foundation Solid:** Infrastructure ready for remaining features

## Next Sprint Priorities

### Recommended Sprint 3 Focus: Epic 3 (Ontology Management)
**Rationale:** With document ingestion complete, we need ontology management to define what entities and relationships to extract from documents.

**Sprint 3 Backlog:**
1. Story 3.1: Ontology List and Management Interface
2. Story 3.2: Entity Type Definition Editor
3. Story 3.3: Edge Type Definition Builder

## Risk Update
- âœ… **Mitigated:** Airtable integration complexity (Epic 1 complete)
- âœ… **Mitigated:** Docling accuracy concerns (>95% achieved)
- ðŸ”¶ **Active:** D3.js performance for 1000+ nodes (Epic 4 concern)
- ðŸ”¶ **Active:** Clone-before-modify storage overhead (Epic 4 concern)

## Development Team Notes
- **James:** Excellent progress on Epics 1 & 2. Clean implementation passing all gates.
- **Quinn:** Thorough gate testing completed for Epic 2 with detailed validation.

## Compliance with BMad Process
- âœ… Story documentation maintained in `/docs/stories/`
- âœ… Gate testing criteria defined in `/docs/qa/gates/`
- âœ… Implementation summaries provided
- âœ… Architecture alignment verified
- âœ… PRD requirements tracked
