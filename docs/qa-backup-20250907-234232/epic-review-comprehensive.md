## Conclusion

The Krypton Graph PRD demonstrates strong functional requirement definition with clear user stories and acceptance criteria. However, several critical gaps in security, performance testing, and operational readiness need addressing before development proceeds.

The clone-before-modify pattern is innovative but requires careful implementation and thorough testing. The integration with multiple external services (Airtable, Docling, OpenAI) introduces significant complexity that demands robust error handling and fallback strategies.

### Next Steps
1. Address authentication/authorization design
2. Define comprehensive test strategy document
3. Establish performance benchmarks
4. Create security threat model
5. Plan disaster recovery procedures
