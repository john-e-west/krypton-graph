# Frontend-PRD Reconciliation Decision Log

**Date:** 2025-01-04  
**Participants:** Sally (UX Expert), John (PM)  
**Decision Type:** Architecture/Design Alignment  
**Status:** Approved  

## Executive Summary

This document captures the decisions made to reconcile conflicts and gaps identified between the Front-End Specification (v1.0) and Product Requirements Document (v1.0) for the Krypton Graph project. The analysis revealed 5 conflicts requiring resolution and multiple gaps in coverage that needed prioritization.

## Context

The Front-End Specification was created by the UX Expert to define the user experience, information architecture, and component design system. Subsequently, the Product Manager and Management team created a PRD that incorporated technical details and lessons learned from previous POC projects. This reconciliation ensures both documents align on scope, technical approach, and implementation priorities.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Conflict Resolutions

#### 1.1 Airtable Integration Approach
**Conflict:** PRD suggested either SDK or REST API, front-end spec was agnostic  
**Decision:** Follow PRD approach - use either Airtable SDK or REST API as determined during implementation  
**Rationale:** Maintains flexibility to choose based on technical constraints discovered during development  
**Impact:** No UI changes required, backend implementation detail  

#### 1.2 Processing Queue Visualization
**Conflict:** PRD specified 5 concurrent documents, front-end spec didn't specify limits  
**Decision:** UI will support displaying up to 5 parallel progress tracks  
**Rationale:** Aligns with backend processing capability and provides clear visual feedback  
**Impact:** Processing queue UI must accommodate 5 concurrent progress indicators  

#### 1.3 Device Support Scope
**Conflict:** PRD emphasized desktop with read-only mobile, front-end spec implied full mobile  
**Decision:** Support desktop browsers with full mobile functionality  
**Rationale:** Modern responsive design practices support this without significant additional effort  
**Impact:** All features must be responsive and touch-friendly  

#### 1.4 Authentication Implementation
**Conflict:** PRD specified JWT with refresh tokens (TBD), front-end spec had no auth  
**Decision:** Simplified authentication for v1.0 - basic login and session management for 1-3 users  
**Rationale:** Early version doesn't need complex auth; can be enhanced later  
**Impact:** Simple login screen required, no complex token refresh logic initially  

#### 1.5 Graph Node Limits
**Conflict:** PRD mentioned 10,000 nodes, front-end spec focused on 1,000 nodes  
**Decision:** Optimize visualization for up to 1,000 nodes in v1.0  
**Rationale:** 1,000 nodes provides sufficient capability for MVP while ensuring performance  
**Impact:** Use virtualization techniques for larger graphs in future versions  

### 2. Scope Prioritization

#### 2.1 Version 1.0 Additions (from Front-End Spec)
The following items from the front-end specification are confirmed as **in-scope for v1.0**:

**Component Implementation Details**
- All 46 shadcn/ui v4 foundation components
- Framer Motion animation specifications
- Dark mode theming with CSS variables

**Accessibility Implementation**
- ARIA patterns and keyboard navigation
- Focus management strategies
- Screen reader optimization
- WCAG AA compliance

**Error Handling UI**
- Component-level error boundaries
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Error state designs

#### 2.2 Version Next - High Priority (from PRD)
The following features are **deferred to Version Next (High Priority)**:

1. **Multi-Source Connectors UI** (Epic 5, Story 5.1)
   - BOX integration
   - Zoom transcript import
   - Exchange email connector
   - Incremental sync

2. **Bulk Operations Interface** (Story 5.6)
   - Multi-select patterns
   - Batch processing UI
   - Bulk action confirmations

3. **Export/Import Functionality**
   - Ontology export UI
   - Graph export interface
   - Query result exports

4. **Monitoring Dashboard** (Story 5.5)
   - System health metrics
   - API usage tracking
   - Performance analytics

#### 2.3 Version Next - Low Priority
The following features are **deferred to Version Next (Low Priority)**:

1. **User Management & Permissions UI**
   - Role assignment
   - Permission matrices
   - Team collaboration

2. **Version Control UI**
   - Ontology versioning
   - Graph history browser
   - Rollback/restore

3. **Advanced Settings & Preferences**
   - User preferences
   - Notification config
   - API key management

4. **Help & Documentation System**
   - In-app help
   - Onboarding flows
   - Interactive tutorials

## Implementation Impact

### Frontend Development
- Focus on core features with full responsive design
- Implement comprehensive shadcn/ui component library
- Ensure accessibility from day one
- Simple auth without complex token management

### Backend Development
- Optimize for 1,000 node graphs initially
- Support 5 concurrent document processing
- Basic session-based authentication
- Flexible Airtable integration approach

### Timeline Impact
- Reduced v1.0 scope enables faster time-to-market
- Complex integrations deferred reduce initial risk
- Clear roadmap for post-v1.0 enhancements

## Success Criteria

### Version 1.0 Success Metrics
- New users can import first document within 10 minutes
- System processes 50+ documents/hour
- Graph visualization renders 1,000 nodes in <1 second
- Full mobile responsiveness across all features
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance

### Version Next Planning Triggers
- Active usage by 10+ users
- 1,000+ documents processed successfully
- User feedback requesting specific deferred features
- Technical debt assessment completed

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Simple auth insufficient for security | Design auth system to be replaceable with JWT in Version Next |
| 1,000 node limit too restrictive | Implement pagination and filtering for larger graphs |
| Mobile functionality complex | Progressive enhancement approach, core features first |
| Missing bulk operations impacts efficiency | Ensure single operations are optimized, add keyboard shortcuts |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Update PRD with v1.0 scope clarifications
   - Update front-end spec with authentication requirements
   - Create technical architecture document

2. **Documentation Updates Required**
   - PRD: Add front-end spec details for components, accessibility, error handling
   - Front-end spec: Add simple authentication screens
   - Both: Update to reflect 1,000 node limit and 5 concurrent processes

3. **Communication**
   - Share decisions with development team
   - Update project roadmap
   - Communicate Version Next priorities to stakeholders

## Decision Authority

**Approved by:**
- Sally (UX Expert) - UI/UX decisions
- John (PM) - Product scope and prioritization
- Management - Version roadmap and resource allocation
