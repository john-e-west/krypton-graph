# Architecture Reconciliation Report

**Date:** 2025-01-04  
**Author:** Winston (System Architect)  
**Purpose:** Compare architecture.md with PRD, front-end-spec.md, and frontend-prd-reconciliation decisions to identify overlaps, conflicts, and gaps

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the four core design documents, I've identified:
- **15 areas of strong overlap/agreement** across all documents
- **8 conflicts** requiring resolution between architecture.md and other docs
- **7 gaps** where the architecture document needs updates or clarification

## 1. OVERLAPS - Areas of Strong Agreement

### Core Technology Stack
âœ… **Complete Alignment** across all documents:
- React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x
- shadcn/ui v4 component library (46 components)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- D3.js for graph visualization
- Airtable as primary data store
- Docling for document processing
- OpenAI API for smart chunking
- React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tanstack Table for data tables

### User Personas & Roles
âœ… **Consistent Definition** in all documents:
- Admin User: System configuration, API keys, monitoring
- Advanced User: Ontology creation, template design
- Standard User: Document import, validation, accept/reject

### Core Workflows
âœ… **Identical Process** across all specifications:
1. Document Import â†’ Docling â†’ Smart Chunks â†’ Review â†’ Impact Assessment â†’ Accept/Reject
2. Clone-before-modify pattern for zero data loss
3. Episode-based processing with audit trails

### Performance Requirements
âœ… **Matching Targets**:
- 50+ documents/hour throughput
- <3 second page loads on 3G
- <1 second for 1000 node rendering
- <200ms API response times
- 99.9% uptime target

### Airtable Schema
âœ… **Consistent 8-Table Structure**:
All documents reference the same table structure and IDs (Ontologies, EntityDefinitions, EdgeDefinitions, TestDatasets, TestRuns, GraphAssignments, FactRatingConfigs, FactRatingTests)

### Key Features
âœ… **Universal Agreement**:
- Command palette (Cmd+K)
- Impact assessment with side-by-side comparison
- Visual ontology designer
- Smart chunk editor with LLM assistance
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance

## 2. CONFLICTS - Requiring Resolution

### ðŸ”´ C1: Authentication Implementation
- **Architecture.md**: States "JWT-based with secure token storage" and "JWT-based with refresh tokens"
- **PRD**: Says "JWT-based with refresh tokens (implementation details TBD)"
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Decided on "Simplified authentication for v1.0 - basic login and session management for 1-3 users"
- **Resolution Needed**: Architecture should adopt the simplified v1.0 approach per reconciliation decision

### ðŸ”´ C2: Graph Node Limits
- **Architecture.md**: References "Performance degrades above 10,000 nodes"
- **PRD**: Mentions processing up to 10,000 nodes
- **Front-end-spec**: Optimized for 1,000 nodes
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Decided to "Optimize visualization for up to 1,000 nodes in v1.0"
- **Resolution Needed**: Architecture should align with 1,000 node limit for v1.0

### ðŸ”´ C3: Concurrent Processing Limits
- **Architecture.md**: No specific concurrent processing limit mentioned
- **PRD**: Specifies "up to 5 documents simultaneously"
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Confirmed "UI will support displaying up to 5 parallel progress tracks"
- **Resolution Needed**: Architecture should specify 5 concurrent document limit

### ðŸ”´ C4: Mobile Support Strategy
- **Architecture.md**: Says "Mobile view provides read-only access"
- **PRD**: Indicates "Primary target is desktop browsers" with "Mobile view provides read-only access"
- **Front-end-spec & Reconciliation**: Decided on "Support desktop browsers with full mobile functionality"
- **Resolution Needed**: Architecture should update to full mobile support per decision

### ðŸ”´ C5: Deployment Target
- **Architecture.md**: Shows "CloudFlare Pages" for frontend and "Vercel/AWS Functions" for API
- **PRD**: Mentions "Vercel or similar JAMstack platform"
- **Resolution Needed**: Clarify single deployment platform or confirm multi-platform strategy

### ðŸ”´ C6: Testing Coverage Targets
- **Architecture.md**: States "Target: 80% code coverage"
- **PRD**: Also states "target 80% coverage"
- **Front-end-spec**: No specific coverage mentioned but comprehensive testing described
- **Note**: While aligned, architecture lacks detail on integration and E2E testing specifics from PRD

### ðŸ”´ C7: Version Control for Ontologies
- **Architecture.md**: Lists "Ontology Version Management" as planned
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Deferred "Version Control UI" to "Version Next - Low Priority"
- **Resolution Needed**: Remove or defer ontology versioning from v1.0 architecture

### ðŸ”´ C8: Multi-Source Connectors
- **Architecture.md**: Lists BOX, Zoom, Exchange as external services
- **PRD**: Has these in Epic 5 (Advanced Processing)
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Deferred to "Version Next - High Priority"
- **Resolution Needed**: Update architecture to show these as future features, not v1.0

## 3. GAPS - Missing or Underspecified in Architecture

### ðŸŸ¡ G1: Component Library Detail
- **Gap**: Architecture mentions "46 shadcn/ui v4 base components" but doesn't detail implementation
- **Front-end-spec**: Provides extensive component patterns, CVA variants, composition examples
- **Needed**: Add component architecture patterns and implementation guidelines

### ðŸŸ¡ G2: Animation & Micro-interactions
- **Gap**: Architecture lists Framer Motion but no animation strategy
- **Front-end-spec**: Detailed animation principles, durations, easing functions
- **Needed**: Add animation system specifications

### ðŸŸ¡ G3: Form Validation Patterns
- **Gap**: Architecture mentions React Hook Form + Zod but lacks implementation details
- **Front-end-spec**: Shows detailed form patterns with validation
- **Needed**: Add form architecture and validation strategy

### ðŸŸ¡ G4: Error Handling UI
- **Gap**: Architecture focuses on backend error handling
- **Front-end-spec**: Describes error boundaries, graceful degradation, error states
- **Needed**: Add frontend error handling patterns

### ðŸŸ¡ G5: Dark Mode Support
- **Gap**: Architecture doesn't mention theming
- **Front-end-spec**: Includes complete dark mode CSS variables
- **Needed**: Add theming architecture and implementation

### ðŸŸ¡ G6: Repository Structure
- **Gap**: Architecture shows high-level structure but missing implementation details
- **PRD**: Specifies "Monorepo" with detailed structure
- **Needed**: Clarify monorepo vs standard structure

### ðŸŸ¡ G7: Implementation Roadmap Alignment
- **Gap**: Architecture Phase 1-4 roadmap doesn't reflect reconciliation decisions
- **Frontend-PRD Reconciliation**: Clear v1.0 vs Version Next priorities
- **Needed**: Update roadmap to match agreed scope

## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Architecture Updates Required

   - Theming architecture
   - Accessibility implementation

2. **Add New Section**: "Version Roadmap"
   - v1.0 scope (aligned with reconciliation)
   - Version Next - High Priority features
   - Version Next - Low Priority features

3. **Update Existing Sections**:
   - Security: Simplify to session-based for v1.0
   - Performance: Focus on 1,000 nodes, 5 concurrent
   - Testing: Add frontend testing patterns
   - Deployment: Clarify platform strategy

## 5. CRITICAL PATH FORWARD

### Must Resolve Before Development
1. âœ… Authentication approach (adopt simple v1.0 approach)
2. âœ… Node/performance limits (1,000 nodes for v1.0)
3. âœ… Mobile support level (full functionality)
4. âœ… Deployment platform (needs clarification)

### Should Update for Clarity
1. Component architecture patterns
2. Animation and interaction specs
3. Error handling UI patterns
4. Version roadmap alignment

### Can Defer to Post-v1.0
1. JWT implementation details
2. 10,000+ node optimizations
3. Multi-source connectors
4. Ontology versioning UI

## Decision Required

The architecture document needs updating to reflect the pragmatic decisions made in the frontend-PRD reconciliation. Key changes:

1. **Simplify v1.0 scope** - Remove complex features deferred to Version Next
2. **Adopt reconciliation decisions** - Simple auth, 1,000 nodes, full mobile
3. **Import front-end patterns** - Component, animation, and error handling details
4. **Align roadmap** - Match the agreed v1.0 vs Version Next prioritization

This will ensure all documents are in sync and the development team has clear, consistent guidance.
