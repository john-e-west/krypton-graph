## Dependencies on Previous Epics

### From Epic 1 (Foundation):
- React/TypeScript setup
- Airtable integration
- Base component library

### From Epic 2 (Document Processing):
- Document-to-graph conversion
- Entity/edge extraction
- Processing pipeline

### From Epic 3 (Ontology):
- Entity type definitions
- Edge type definitions
- Ontology-graph linkage

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance with Large Graphs** (High)
   - Mitigation: Implement virtualization, pagination, and lazy loading
   
2. **D3.js Complexity** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Use proven patterns, consider alternative libraries if needed

3. **Query Performance** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize Airtable queries

### Dependency Risks
1. **Airtable API Limits** (High)
   - Mitigation: Batch operations, implement rate limiting, consider caching layer

2. **OpenAI API for NL Queries** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Fallback to structured queries, cache common patterns

## Success Criteria
1. Users can create and manage multiple knowledge graphs
2. All modifications go through clone-review-accept workflow
3. Impact of changes is clearly visualized before acceptance
4. Graph can be explored visually with smooth interactions
5. Natural language queries return accurate results
6. Complete audit trail exists for all changes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Epic Assessment:** Epic 4 demonstrates comprehensive knowledge graph operations architecture with well-defined stories and clear acceptance criteria. All 6 stories show complete development work with proper component structures, testing standards, and shadcn-ui integration.

**Strengths:**
- Complete clone-before-modify safety pattern implementation
- Comprehensive impact assessment with confidence scoring
- Strong component architecture and type definitions
- Proper testing coverage and performance considerations
- Clear dependency management between stories

**Areas of Concern:**
- Performance risks with graphs approaching 1,000 node limit need proactive mitigation
- D3.js complexity in visualization components may impact maintainability  
- Airtable API rate limiting poses reliability risks across all operations
- Performance testing requirements need concrete benchmarks

**Recommendation:** Proceed with development while prioritizing performance validation and establishing clear performance benchmarks early in Sprint 4.
