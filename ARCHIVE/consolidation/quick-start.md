# üöÄ Quick Start: Documentation Consolidation

## Your Systematic Process is Ready!

### üìç Where to Start

1. **Review the Process**: `docs/consolidation-process.md`
   - Complete workflow with templates
   - Evaluation criteria and decision matrix
   - Organization structure

2. **Track Progress**: `docs/consolidation/review-log.md`
   - Lists all identified sources
   - Template for documenting each review session

### üéØ Recommended First Steps

#### Option 1: Quick Survey (30 minutes)
Do a rapid scan of all sources to get the lay of the land:
```bash
# Quick peek at Convex documentation
ls -la DOCUMENTATION/convex_documentation/

# Quick peek at Zep documentation  
ls -la DOCUMENTATION/zep_documentation/

# Check the admin UI example
ls -la EXAMPLES/admin-ui/

# Look at the ontology creation script
head -50 EXAMPLES/create_example_ontologies.py
```

#### Option 2: Deep Dive One Source (1-2 hours)
Pick the most relevant source and do a thorough review:
- Apply the evaluation matrix
- Extract key requirements
- Identify reusable patterns
- Document in review log

#### Option 3: Thematic Review (2-3 hours)
Focus on one aspect across all sources:
- **Data Models**: Look for schemas/ontologies across all sources
- **UI/UX**: Review all frontend implementations
- **APIs**: Examine all API designs and patterns
- **Architecture**: Identify common architectural decisions

### üìù For Each Review Session

1. **Before Starting**:
   - Open `docs/consolidation/review-log.md`
   - Have the evaluation matrix handy
   - Create a new review session entry

2. **During Review**:
   - Use the templates in `docs/consolidation-process.md`
   - Extract content to appropriate `/extracted` folders
   - Tag everything with source references

3. **After Review**:
   - Update the review log
   - Commit extracted content
   - Note any follow-up questions

### ü§î Key Questions to Answer

For each source, ask:
1. What problem was this solving?
2. What worked well?
3. What didn't work or was abandoned?
4. What would we do differently now?
5. What can be reused as-is?
6. What needs adaptation for the new context?

### üí° Pro Tips

- **Start with the most recent implementations** - they likely incorporate lessons learned
- **Look for patterns** - similar solutions across different implementations validate the approach
- **Document the "why" not just the "what"** - context is crucial for future decisions
- **Don't over-analyze** - use the INSPIRE category liberally for interesting but not immediately applicable content

### üé¨ Ready to Begin?

Pick your starting approach and dive in! The systematic process will help ensure nothing important is missed while keeping the review focused and efficient.

Would you like me to:
1. Start reviewing a specific source with you?
2. Help you do a quick survey of all sources?
3. Focus on extracting a particular type of content (requirements, architecture, stories)?
4. Request additional proof of concept projects?
