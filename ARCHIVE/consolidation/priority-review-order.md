# Priority Review Order

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Review Sequence

Based on the Airtable decision and the discovered krypton-prototype POCs, here's the prioritized review order:

### Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Foundations (HIGH PRIORITY)
Since we're using Airtable with an existing knowledge graph schema, review these first:

1. **krypton-prototype/ZEP_POC_SUMMARY.md** 
   - Complete overview of Zep/Graphiti implementation
   - Knowledge graph concepts that align with Airtable schema
   - Entity and edge type definitions

2. **EXAMPLES/create_example_ontologies.py**
   - Likely contains ontology creation patterns
   - Should align with existing Airtable Ontologies table
   
3. **krypton-prototype/zep_entity_edge_types_poc.py**
   - Entity/Edge type research
   - Can inform our EntityDefinitions and EdgeDefinitions tables

### Phase 2: Core Zep Implementation (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
Understand the Zep platform patterns that might complement Airtable:

4. **DOCUMENTATION/zep_documentation**
   - Full documentation set
   - May contain patterns for graph operations
   
5. **krypton-prototype/zep_comprehensive_test.py**
   - Complete functionality demonstration
   - Integration patterns

6. **EXAMPLES/zep_examples**
   - Additional Zep implementation examples

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
More sophisticated POCs that could inspire features:

7. **krypton-prototype/zep_episode_analysis.py**
   - Episode/session analysis patterns
   
8. **krypton-prototype/zep_impact_assessment.py**
   - Impact assessment tooling
   
9. **krypton-prototype/zep_cascade_impact_test.py**
   - Cascade effects in graph

### Phase 4: UI/Frontend Patterns (LOWER PRIORITY)
Once backend is clear, review frontend:

10. **EXAMPLES/admin-ui**
    - Admin interface patterns
    - Could work with Airtable views
    
11. **EXAMPLES/docs**
    - Documentation or UI examples

### Phase 5: Supporting POCs (LOWEST PRIORITY)
Additional implementations for reference:

12. **krypton-prototype/zep_poc.py**
    - Basic implementation (covered by comprehensive test)
    
13. **krypton-prototype/zep_clone_impact_assessment.py**
    - Variant of impact assessment

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights from Initial Discovery

### Why This Order?

1. **Knowledge Graph Focus**: The krypton-prototype heavily uses Zep/Graphiti for temporal knowledge graphs, which aligns perfectly with our Airtable schema (Ontologies â†’ Entities â†’ Edges)

2. **Zep as Complementary Tech**: While Airtable is our database, Zep's patterns for:
   - Entity/edge type management
   - Graph operations
   - Temporal tracking
   ...could inform how we structure operations on top of Airtable

3. **Existing Schema Alignment**: Our Airtable already has:
   - Ontologies table (matches Zep ontology concept)
   - EntityDefinitions (matches Zep entity types)
   - EdgeDefinitions (matches Zep edge types)
   - TestDatasets & TestRuns (validation infrastructure)

### Integration Hypothesis

Based on the POC summary, we might consider:
- **Airtable**: Primary data storage and schema management
- **Zep patterns**: Graph operations and entity/relationship extraction
- **Hybrid approach**: Use Airtable for persistence, adopt Zep's patterns for processing

## ðŸ“‹ Next Action

Start with **krypton-prototype/ZEP_POC_SUMMARY.md** as it provides:
- Complete overview of what was built
- API usage examples
- Key insights about entity/edge types
- Already documented lessons learned

This will inform whether Zep patterns should be:
- ADOPTED (use Zep alongside Airtable)
- ADAPTED (implement Zep patterns using Airtable)
- INSPIRED (take concepts but implement differently)
- REJECTED (stick with pure Airtable approach)
