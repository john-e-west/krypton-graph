# Krypton Graph UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Krypton Graph's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Admin User**
- Deep technical system knowledge
- Responsible for system setup, authentication, and API key management
- Monitors system health and manages user access
- Primary goals: System stability, security, and user enablement

**Advanced User**
- Understands ontologies and their role in knowledge graph structure
- Creates and manages custom entity and edge types
- Designs reusable ontology templates for different domains
- Primary goals: Build robust, flexible knowledge structures

**Standard User**
- Understands document categorization and appropriate knowledge graph selection
- Validates entity and edge extraction from imported documents
- Reviews impact assessments and makes accept/reject decisions
- Primary goals: Accurate data import and quality control

#### Usability Goals

- **Ease of learning:** New users can import and verify their first document within 10 minutes
- **Efficiency of use:** Advanced users can create complete ontologies with minimal friction
- **Error prevention:** Clone-before-modify pattern ensures zero data loss risk
- **Transparency:** Every change is stored, tracked, reported, and reversible (roll-back with clone image or re-play past transactions to rebuild graph)
- **Confidence building:** Impact assessments provide clear visibility before committing changes

#### Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show complexity only when needed, basic users see simple interfaces
2. **Visual Clarity** - Make processes immediately understandable and the relationship between source/example text the ontology rules/filters and the resulting entities/edges immediately understandable
3. **Safety First** - All destructive actions require confirmation and provide rollback options
4. **Consistent Patterns** - Similar operations use similar UI patterns across all modules
5. **Data Transparency** - Users always know what data exists, what changed, and why

### Change Log

## User Journey Maps

### Admin User Journey - System Setup & Maintenance

**Goal:** Configure and maintain the Krypton Graph system for organizational use

**Journey Stages:**
```
INITIAL SETUP → CONFIGURATION → MONITORING → MAINTENANCE
      ↓             ↓              ↓            ↓
[First Access] [API Setup]   [User Mgmt]  [System Health]
```

**Key Touchpoints:**
1. Login → Admin Dashboard
2. Environment Variables Setup (ZEP, OpenAI, Database)
3. API Key Management with secure storage
4. User Role Assignment and permissions
5. System Monitoring Dashboard with real-time metrics
6. Troubleshooting tools and support access

**Emotional Journey:** 😰 Overwhelmed → 😤 Focused → 😌 Confident → 😊 Satisfied

### Advanced User Journey - Ontology Design & Graph Creation

**Goal:** Design ontologies and create knowledge graphs for different data domains

**Journey Stages:**
```
LEARN → DESIGN → CREATE → TEST → DEPLOY → MANAGE
   ↓       ↓        ↓       ↓       ↓        ↓
[Explore] [Define] [Build] [Validate] [Use] [Evolve]
```

**Key Touchpoints:**
1. Ontology Designer Interface with visual builder
2. Entity Type Builder (Pydantic wrapper UI)
3. Edge Type Builder with relationship examples
4. Grouping & Naming Ontologies for reusability
5. Knowledge Graph Creation with ontology assignment
6. Clone/Test/Delete Operations
7. Ontology Version Management and evolution

**Emotional Journey:** 🤔 Curious → 💡 Inspired → 🔨 Building → ✅ Validated → 😎 Expert

### Standard User Journey - Document Import & Verification

**Goal:** Import documents and verify correct entity/edge extraction

**Journey Stages:**
```
PREPARE → IMPORT → PROCESS → REVIEW → DECIDE → TRACK
    ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓        ↓       ↓
[Select KG] [Upload] [Chunk] [Assess] [Accept] [History]
```

**Key Touchpoints:**
1. Selection interface of active Knowledge Graphs as target for USER's document upload 
2. Selection interface of file(s) to upload. File(s) processed into mark down format using Docling. Markdown stored in krypton-graph's relational DB.
3. Review chunks of mark down that an LLM created and enriched with meta data, these 'smart chunks' provide an option for review and course correction by the USER before step 4.  
4. Impact Assessment Report generation created after SYSTEM clones KG before  importing all approved smart chunks. SYSTEM compares the differences between the two KGs. The impact report UI lists all changes to entity/edges in the KG. The USER can Accept/Reject the new KG.
5. History & Audit Trail lists all previous Accept/Reject decisions with links to past Impact Assessment Report. 

**Emotional Journey:** 📄 Ready → ⏳ Waiting → 🔍 Analyzing → 🤓 Evaluating → ✅ Decided → 📊 Informed

### Critical User Flows

#### Ontology Creation Flow (Advanced User)

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Select Knowledge Graph] --> Upload[Select Documents to Upload]
    Upload --> ChunkReview[Review Smart Chunks]
    ChunkReview --> ApproveChunks{Approve Chunks?}
    ApproveChunks -->|No| EditChunks[Edit Chunk Boundaries]
    EditChunks --> ChunkReview
    ApproveChunks -->|Yes| CloneGraph[Clone Master → Copy]

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

- **Purposeful:** Every animation serves a functional purpose
- **Fast:** Keep durations under 300ms for UI transitions
- **Smooth:** Use easing functions (ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting)
- **Respectful:** Honor prefers-reduced-motion settings
- **Consistent:** Same actions produce same animations

### Key Animations

- **Page Transitions:** Fade with subtle slide (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Graph Node Hover:** Scale up 1.1x with shadow (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Accordion Expand:** Height auto with fade (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton pulse animation (Duration: 1.5s, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success Feedback:** Check mark draw-in (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Error Shake:** Horizontal shake 3x (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial load under 3 seconds on 3G
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms for user input feedback
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60 FPS for all animations

### Design Strategies

- Use virtual scrolling for large lists and tables
- Implement progressive loading for graph visualizations
- Lazy load images and non-critical components
- Use skeleton screens during data fetching
- Optimize SVG complexity for graph rendering
- Implement debouncing for search and filter inputs
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Cache frequently accessed data locally
