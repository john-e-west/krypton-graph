# Project Requirements Document

**Project**: Krypton Graph Platform  
**Version**: 2.1  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: In Development  

## Executive Summary

The Krypton Graph Platform enables organizations to transform unstructured documents into queryable knowledge graphs, facilitating better information discovery and decision-making.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Document Upload System
- **Description**: Users must be able to upload documents through a web interface
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support for PDF, TXT, MD, and DOCX formats
  - Maximum file size of 50MB per document
  - Batch upload capability (up to 10 files)
  - Progress tracking and cancellation options
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### FR-2: Content Processing
- **Description**: System shall extract and process document content
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Text extraction from all supported formats
  - Metadata preservation (author, creation date, etc.)
  - Content chunking for optimal processing
  - Error recovery for corrupted files

### FR-3: Knowledge Graph Generation
- **Description**: Convert processed content into graph structures
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Entity recognition and extraction
  - Relationship identification
  - Ontology alignment
  - Graph validation and consistency checks

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Upload processing: < 30 seconds for files up to 50MB
- Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous uploads
- Response time: < 2 seconds for UI interactions
- Throughput: Process 1000+ documents per hour

### NFR-2: Security
- File validation: Strict MIME type and extension checking
- Content scanning: Malware detection before processing
- Access control: User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption: At rest and in transit

### NFR-3: Reliability
- Uptime: 99.9% availability target
- Data integrity: Zero data loss guarantee
- Error recovery: Automatic retry mechanisms
- Backup: Daily automated backups

### NFR-4: Usability
- Interface: Intuitive drag-and-drop upload
- Feedback: Real-time progress indicators
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Documentation: Comprehensive user guides

## Technical Constraints

### System Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Next.js
- **Database**: Neo4j for graph storage
- **Storage**: Cloud-based file storage
- **APIs**: RESTful with GraphQL for complex queries

### Integration Requirements
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration for user management
- **Analytics**: ZEP integration for conversation memory
- **Data Management**: Airtable for metadata storage
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80% code coverage minimum
- Integration tests: End-to-end upload workflows
- Performance tests: Load testing with realistic data
- Security tests: Penetration testing and vulnerability scans

### Acceptance Criteria
- All functional requirements implemented
- Performance targets met under load
- Security requirements validated
- User acceptance testing completed

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Upload (Completed)
- Basic file upload interface ✓
- File validation and processing ✓
- Initial error handling ✓

### Phase 2: Enhanced Processing (In Progress)
- Advanced content extraction
- Graph generation algorithms
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Planned)
- Security hardening
- Monitoring implementation
- User training and documentation

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **File Processing Failures**: Mitigation through robust error handling
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Load testing and optimization
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Comprehensive training and documentation
2. **Integration Issues**: Thorough testing with external systems
3. **Data Quality**: Automated validation and quality checks

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 80% of target users actively using the system
- **Performance**: All NFR targets consistently met
- **Quality**: < 1% error rate in document processing
- **Satisfaction**: User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
