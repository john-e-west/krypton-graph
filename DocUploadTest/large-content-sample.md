### Understanding Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs represent information as networks of interconnected entities and relationships. They provide a powerful way to organize, store, and query complex information structures that traditional databases struggle to handle effectively.

#### Core Components

**Entities**: The fundamental building blocks of knowledge graphs, representing discrete objects, concepts, or individuals in the real world. Examples include:
- People (employees, customers, researchers)
- Organizations (companies, institutions, departments)  
- Products (software, hardware, services)
- Concepts (ideas, methodologies, processes)
- Locations (cities, buildings, countries)
- Documents (reports, papers, specifications)

**Relationships**: The connections between entities that define how they interact or relate to one another. Common relationship types include:
- Hierarchical relationships (parent/child, manager/employee)
- Associative relationships (collaborates_with, similar_to)
- Temporal relationships (before, after, during)
- Causal relationships (causes, influences, results_in)
- Semantic relationships (is_a, part_of, belongs_to)

**Attributes**: Properties that describe entities and provide additional context. These can include:
- Static properties (name, ID, creation_date)
- Dynamic properties (status, last_updated, current_value)
- Computed properties (age, duration, score)
- Metadata (source, confidence, validation_status)

### Implementation Architecture
