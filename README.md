# Krypton Graph

A knowledge graph management system with temporal capabilities, designed for AI-augmented document processing and relationship tracking.

## Project Status

**Phase: Requirements & Architecture** ✅  
This repository represents the completion of the requirements and architecture phase for the Krypton Graph project.

## Overview

Krypton Graph is a sophisticated knowledge management platform that combines:
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Track entity relationships and changes over time
- **AI-Powered Document Processing**: Intelligent extraction and classification
- **Visual Graph Exploration**: Interactive network visualization
- **Multi-User Support**: Role-based access with Admin, Advanced, and Standard user tiers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with shadcn/ui v4 component library
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: Airtable (via MCP integration)
- **Document Processing**: Docling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Documentation

### Core Documents

- [`/docs/prd.md`](./docs/prd.md) - Product Requirements Document v1.0
- [`/docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) - Complete system architecture
- [`/docs/front-end-spec.md`](./docs/front-end-spec.md) - Authoritative UI/UX specification v1.1
- [`/docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/) - Sharded architecture components
- [`/docs/user-stories/`](./docs/user-stories/) - User journey documentation

### Planning & Decisions

- [`/docs/version-roadmap.md`](./docs/version-roadmap.md) - Feature roadmap and version planning
- [`/docs/decisions/`](./docs/decisions/) - Architecture decision records
  - [`2025-01-04-frontend-prd-reconciliation.md`](./docs/decisions/2025-01-04-frontend-prd-reconciliation.md) - Alignment decisions between Frontend and PRD

### Architecture Highlights

The system follows a clone-before-modify pattern ensuring zero data loss:
1. All modifications create versioned clones
2. Original data is never destroyed
3. Complete audit trail maintained
4. Temporal navigation supported

## Key Features

### Document Processing Pipeline
- **Smart Chunking**: Intelligent document segmentation
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automated tagging and classification
- **Impact Assessment**: Change analysis and validation
- **Version Control**: Complete document history

### Knowledge Graph Capabilities
- **Entity Management**: Create, update, and track entities
- **Relationship Mapping**: Define and visualize connections
- **Temporal Navigation**: View graph state at any point in time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify clusters and relationships

### User Experience
- **Three-Tier Access**: Admin, Advanced, and Standard users
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in theme support

## Database Schema

The system uses an 8-table Airtable schema:
- Entities & Entity Types
- Edges & Edge Types
- Attributes & Attribute Values
- Episodes & Metadata

## Development Status

### Completed ✅
- Requirements gathering and analysis (PRD v1.0)
- System architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Database schema design
- UI/UX specification (v1.1)
- Component library selection (shadcn/ui v4)
- Frontend-PRD reconciliation and alignment
- Version roadmap and prioritization

### Version 1.0 Scope (In Development)
- Simple authentication for 1-3 users
- Document processing pipeline with Docling
- Airtable integration (8 tables)
- Graph visualization (up to 1,000 nodes)
- Visual ontology designer
- Impact assessment workflow
- Full mobile responsiveness
- WCAG AA accessibility

### Deferred to Version 1.1+
- Multi-source connectors (BOX, Zoom, Exchange)
- Bulk operations interface
- Advanced monitoring dashboard
- Complex JWT authentication
- See [`version-roadmap.md`](./docs/version-roadmap.md) for full details
