recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Implement auth test fixtures first"
    - "Set up Clerk test tenant"
    - "Create 1000+ record test dataset"
    
  future:
    - "Add production smoke test suite"
    - "Implement performance benchmarks"
    - "Add cross-browser testing for real-time"
    - "Create chaos testing for webhooks"

gate_decision:
  status: PASS
  confidence: high
  rationale: |
    Comprehensive test design with strong security focus.
    All critical paths covered with appropriate test levels.
    Clear prioritization enables risk-based execution.
  
  conditions:
    - "All P0 tests must pass before deployment"
    - "Auth tests are blocking for all environments"
    - "Performance limits must be enforced"
