  technical_debt:
    - "Browser compatibility matrix incomplete"
    - "Visual regression testing not implemented"
    - "PWA features not tested"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Setup React Testing Library with Clerk mocks"
    - "Configure test user accounts in Clerk"
    - "Create Convex test deployment"
    - "Document environment variable requirements"
    
  future:
    - "Implement Cypress E2E test suite"
    - "Add visual regression testing with Percy"
    - "Create accessibility test suite"
    - "Add synthetic monitoring for real-time features"
    - "Implement performance budgets"

dependencies:
  required_before_testing:
    - "SETUP-001 completion (Convex backend)"
    - "Clerk test tenant setup"
    - "Test data fixtures"
    
  tools_needed:
    - "React Testing Library"
    - "Cypress or Playwright"
    - "Jest with TypeScript"
    - "MSW for API mocking"

gate_decision:
  status: PASS
  confidence: high
  rationale: |
    Strong test coverage for authentication and protected routes.
    Real-time functionality adequately tested.
    Frontend integration well covered with appropriate test levels.
    Some gaps in NFRs but acceptable for initial release.
  
  conditions:
    - "All P0 tests must pass (19 tests)"
    - "Clerk integration fully validated"
    - "Protected routes enforce authentication"
    - "TypeScript strict mode enabled"
    
  warnings:
    - "Accessibility testing should be prioritized soon"
    - "Performance testing needed before production"
    - "Browser compatibility matrix should be completed"
