- **Data Consistency**: 100% for assignment state management
- **Activity Logging**: 100% capture rate for tracked events

## Coverage Gaps Assessment

All acceptance criteria have appropriate test coverage. The story being P2 priority allows for focused testing on core functionality with lighter coverage on advanced features.

**Strengths:**
- Strong security and data integrity testing
- Complete assignment workflow coverage
- Comprehensive workload management validation

**Areas for future enhancement:**
- Load testing with large user bases
- Advanced collaboration feature testing
- Cross-browser compatibility for complex UI interactions

## Test Environment Requirements

### Unit Tests:
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Mock Convex API calls
- Mock Chart.js components
- Simulated user permission contexts

### Integration Tests:
- Test Convex backend with user/assignment data
- Real-time presence simulation
- Permission enforcement validation
- Activity logging verification

### E2E Tests:
- Full application with authentication
- Multiple user contexts for role testing
- Real-time collaboration testing
- Workload visualization validation

## Quality Metrics Targets

- **Unit Test Coverage**: >85% for assignment logic and security
- **Integration Coverage**: >75% for data operations and real-time features
- **E2E Coverage**: All P0 and P1 user workflows
- **Security Compliance**: 100% of permission scenarios tested
- **Performance Compliance**: All performance targets met

## Risk Mitigation Through Testing

- **Security Risk**: Comprehensive role-based access testing at all levels
- **Data Integrity Risk**: Assignment validation and duplicate prevention
- **Collaboration Risk**: Real-time presence and conflict detection testing
- **Performance Risk**: Workload calculation efficiency testing
- **User Experience Risk**: Complete workflow validation for all user roles

This test design ensures the User Assignment Management system provides secure, efficient team collaboration with clear workload visibility and proper access control for the ontology management workflow.
