Date: 2025-09-01  
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)  
Story: SETUP-002 - Frontend Framework Setup  
Epic: SETUP-EPIC-001  

## Test Strategy Overview

- **Total test scenarios:** 38
- **Unit tests:** 12 (32%)
- **Integration tests:** 17 (45%)
- **E2E tests:** 9 (23%)
- **Priority distribution:** P0: 19, P1: 14, P2: 5

## Critical Risk Areas Identified

1. **Authentication Flow** - Clerk integration with Convex must be seamless
2. **Protected Routes** - Unauthorized access prevention
3. **Real-time Subscriptions** - Auth context must persist across WebSocket connections
4. **Role-Based UI** - Proper UI elements based on user permissions
5. **Build Configuration** - TypeScript strict mode and bundling

## Authentication & Security Test Coverage

### Authentication Flow Tests (P0 - Critical)
- Sign-in/Sign-up component rendering
- Clerk token generation and validation
- Token passing to Convex backend
- Session persistence across page refreshes
- Logout clearing all auth state

### Protected Route Tests (P0 - Critical)
- Unauthenticated users redirected to sign-in
- Authenticated users access protected pages
- Role-based UI elements visibility
- Deep linking to protected routes
- Auth state preserved during navigation

## Real-time Functionality Tests

### Convex Subscription Tests (P0/P1)
- Initial data load with authentication
- Live updates received when authenticated
- Subscription cleanup on logout
- Reconnection after network interruption
- Multiple concurrent subscriptions

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Frontend Performance (P1)
- Initial page load time < 3 seconds
- Hot reload time < 1 second
- Bundle size analysis (< 500KB initial)
- Code splitting effectiveness
- Lazy loading of routes

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

## Test Data Requirements

### Required Test Data
- Valid Clerk test accounts (admin, editor, viewer roles)
- Invalid/expired JWT tokens for negative testing
- Test Convex deployment URL
- Sample ontology data for real-time testing

### Test Environment Setup
```yaml
test_environment:
  frontend_server: localhost:3000
  convex_test: Test deployment URL
  clerk_test: Test publishable key
  browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile viewports
```

## Coverage Gaps & Limitations

### Known Gaps
- SSR/SSG not tested (SPA only)
- Offline functionality not covered
- PWA features not implemented
- Accessibility (a11y) testing deferred
- Performance testing under load

### Mitigation for Gaps
- Document SPA-only architecture decision
- Add offline detection and messaging
- Plan accessibility audit for next phase
- Implement synthetic monitoring post-launch

## Quality Checklist

- ✅ Every AC has test coverage
- ✅ Test levels are appropriate (good unit/integration balance)
- ✅ No significant duplicate coverage
- ✅ Priorities align with user-facing risks
- ✅ Test IDs follow naming convention
- ✅ Scenarios are atomic and independent
- ✅ Auth flow thoroughly tested
- ✅ Real-time functionality covered
- ✅ Responsive design validated

## Implementation Notes

1. **Clerk Integration Priority**: Test both ClerkProvider and ConvexProviderWithClerk integration thoroughly as this is the critical auth bridge.

2. **Protected Routes**: Test both positive (authenticated) and negative (unauthenticated) scenarios for every protected route.

3. **Real-time Testing**: Verify subscriptions maintain auth context, especially after token refresh.

4. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Ensure all type errors are caught during build, not runtime.

5. **Mobile-First Testing**: Given admin nature, test tablet/mobile layouts even if desktop is primary.

6. **Environment Variables**: Test with missing/invalid env vars to ensure helpful error messages.

## Test Implementation Patterns

### Component Testing Pattern
```typescript
// Test protected route component
describe('ProtectedRoute', () => {
  it('redirects to sign-in when not authenticated', () => {
    // Mock useUser to return isSignedIn: false
    // Render ProtectedRoute
    // Assert redirect to /sign-in
  })
  
  it('renders children when authenticated', () => {
    // Mock useUser to return isSignedIn: true
    // Render ProtectedRoute with child component
    // Assert child component renders
  })
})
```

### Integration Testing Pattern
```typescript
// Test Convex with auth
describe('Convex Auth Integration', () => {
  it('includes auth token in Convex requests', async () => {
    // Setup Clerk mock with valid token
    // Setup Convex client
    // Make authenticated query
    // Verify token in request headers
  })
})
```

## Next Steps

1. Setup React Testing Library with Clerk mocks
2. Configure Cypress for E2E testing
3. Create test user accounts in Clerk
4. Setup test Convex deployment
5. Implement visual regression testing
6. Add performance monitoring
