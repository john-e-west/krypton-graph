Date: 2025-09-01  
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)  
Story: SETUP-001 - Convex Project Initialization  
Epic: SETUP-EPIC-001  

## Test Strategy Overview

- **Total test scenarios:** 42
- **Unit tests:** 18 (43%)
- **Integration tests:** 19 (45%)
- **E2E tests:** 5 (12%)
- **Priority distribution:** P0: 24, P1: 13, P2: 5

## Critical Risk Areas Identified

1. **Authentication Security** - All public functions must verify user identity
2. **Data Integrity** - Schema validation and referential integrity 
3. **Performance** - Pagination and query limits to prevent OOM
4. **Role-Based Access Control** - Proper permission enforcement
5. **Audit Trail** - Complete activity logging for compliance

- Invalid token handling
- Expired token behavior
- Role escalation prevention
- Audit trail completeness

### Data Protection Tests (P0 - Critical)
- SQL injection prevention (Convex parameterized queries)
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting verification
- Query result size limits

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Query Performance (P1 - High)
- Large dataset pagination (10K+ records)
- Index utilization verification
- Subscription scalability (100+ concurrent)
- Mutation throughput testing

## Risk Mitigation Coverage

| Risk | Test Coverage | Mitigation Strategy |

| Schema Drift | SETUP-001-INT-004/005/006 | Automated deployment validation |
| Developer Onboarding | SETUP-001-E2E-003 | Clear setup documentation |

## Recommended Execution Order

### Phase 1: Critical Security (P0)
1. All authentication unit tests (UNIT-008 through 013)
2. Auth integration tests (INT-007/008/010)
3. Schema validation tests (UNIT-002 through 007)

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (P0)
1. Schema deployment tests (INT-004/005)
2. CRUD operation tests (INT-009/011/012)
3. Pagination and limits (UNIT-014)

### Phase 3: User Workflows (P1)
1. Complete lifecycle E2E tests
2. Real-time subscription tests
3. Audit and logging verification

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (P2)
1. Setup and configuration tests
2. Type generation validation
3. Documentation completeness

## Test Data Requirements

### Required Test Data
- Valid Clerk JWT tokens for different roles
- Sample ontology data (min 1000 records for pagination)
- Invalid/malformed input samples
- Edge case values (empty strings, nulls, max lengths)

### Test Environment Setup
```yaml
test_environment:
  convex_dev: Required - isolated deployment
  clerk_test: Required - test tenant
  sample_data: Generated via fixtures
  cleanup: Automated after each test run
```

## Coverage Gaps & Limitations

### Known Gaps
- Production deployment testing (requires separate environment)
- Load testing at scale (deferred to performance testing phase)
- Cross-browser real-time subscription behavior
- Webhook retry logic under failure conditions

### Mitigation for Gaps
- Manual production smoke tests post-deployment
- Separate performance test suite planned
- Browser matrix testing in QA environment
- Webhook monitoring and alerting setup

Performance tests: 4  

## Quality Checklist

- ✅ Every AC has test coverage
- ✅ Test levels are appropriate (shift-left applied)
- ✅ No duplicate coverage across levels
- ✅ Priorities align with business risk
- ✅ Test IDs follow naming convention
- ✅ Scenarios are atomic and independent
- ✅ Security tests prioritized as P0
- ✅ Performance considerations included
- ✅ Audit and compliance covered

## Implementation Notes

1. **Authentication Testing Priority**: Given the critical nature of auth, all auth-related tests are P0 and should block deployment if failing.

2. **Pagination Testing**: The 1000-record limit is critical for preventing OOM errors. Test with exactly 1000, 1001, and 10000 records.

3. **Audit Trail**: Every mutation test should verify audit log creation with correct user attribution.

4. **Internal vs Public Functions**: Ensure clear separation - internal functions should be unreachable from client.

5. **Role Hierarchy**: Test that admin > editor > viewer permissions cascade correctly.

6. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Test both initial load and live updates, including auth context changes.

## Next Steps

1. Implement test fixtures for user roles and sample data
2. Create automated test runner configuration  
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with test gates
4. Document test execution procedures
5. Create performance baseline metrics
