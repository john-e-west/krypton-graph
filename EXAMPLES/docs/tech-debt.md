# Technical Debt Backlog

## Overview
This document tracks technical debt items that should be addressed in future sprints. These are non-blocking improvements that would enhance system quality, performance, or maintainability.

## Active Tech Debt Items

### REL-001: Missing Circuit Breaker for Zep API
**Source:** CORE-003 QA Review  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** The Zep sync system lacks a circuit breaker pattern to handle prolonged API failures gracefully.  
**Impact:** Without circuit breaker, prolonged Zep API outages could cause cascade failures and resource exhaustion.  
**Suggested Solution:** Implement circuit breaker pattern with failure threshold and recovery time settings.  
**Files Affected:** `convex/lib/zepClient.ts`, `convex/zepSync.ts`  
**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** Medium - Important for production resilience  

### ARCH-001: Hard-coded Batch Sizes
**Source:** CORE-003 QA Review  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Batch size for sync operations is hard-coded to 50, should be configurable.  
**Impact:** Cannot optimize batch sizes for different ontology sizes or system conditions.  
**Suggested Solution:** Add environment variable or ontology-specific batch size configuration.  
**Files Affected:** `convex/zepSyncImpl.ts`  
**Effort Estimate:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** Low - Optimization opportunity

## Guidelines for Tech Debt Management

### Adding New Items
1. Use format: **CATEGORY-NUMBER** (e.g., PERF-001, SEC-002)
2. Include source (story, review, incident)
3. Estimate effort and priority
4. Link to affected files

### Categories
- **REL**: Reliability improvements
- **PERF**: Performance optimizations  
- **SEC**: Security enhancements
- **MNT**: Maintainability improvements
- **ARCH**: Architecture refinements
- **DOC**: Documentation gaps

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Should address within 2 sprints
- **Medium**: Address within 1 quarter
- **Low**: Address as capacity allows

### Resolution Process
1. Move completed items to "Completed Items" section
2. Include completion date and brief note
3. Remove items that become irrelevant
