Environment Variables:
  - CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT (production)
  - ZEP_API_KEY (secured)
  - ZEP_API_URL (production)
  - SENTRY_DSN (optional)
```

### Story 2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (DEPLOY-002)

  - Run unit tests
  - Build application
  - Deploy to staging (PR)
  - Deploy to production (main)
  - Smoke tests post-deploy
```

### Story 3: Documentation & Handoff Package (DEPLOY-003)
**Points:** 5  
**Description:** Create comprehensive documentation package for stakeholders and future developers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] README with quick start guide
- [ ] API documentation (auto-generated)
- [ ] User guide with screenshots

```

### Story 4: Monitoring & Observability Setup (DEPLOY-004)
**Points:** 3  
**Description:** Implement basic monitoring, error tracking, and performance monitoring for production environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Uptime monitoring configured
- [ ] Basic alerting rules set
- [ ] Logging aggregation setup
- [ ] Dashboard for key metrics

**Monitoring Stack:**
```typescript
// Monitoring configuration
- Error tracking: Sentry
- Analytics: Vercel/Netlify Analytics
- Uptime: Better Uptime or Pingdom
- Logs: Vercel/Netlify logs
- Custom metrics: Convex dashboard
```

## Technical Requirements

**Production Infrastructure:**
- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Environment variable management
- CDN for static assets
- Rate limiting configured
- Backup strategy defined

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] API keys secured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Input validation active
- [ ] XSS protection enabled
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers set

**Performance Targets:**
- Time to First Byte < 200ms
- Lighthouse score > 80
- 99% uptime SLA
- Page load < 3 seconds

## Dependencies
- All previous epics completed
- Production accounts created
- Domain name (optional)
- Monitoring service accounts

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Production deployment issues  
**Mitigation:** Deploy to staging first, have rollback plan ready  
**Secondary Risk:** Missing critical documentation  
**Mitigation:** Use documentation templates, get team review  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Application live on production URL
- [ ] All features verified in production
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline executing successfully
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and complete
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Stakeholder demo completed
- [ ] Handoff checklist complete
- [ ] Team trained on deployment process

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Production URL shared with stakeholders
- [ ] Access credentials distributed
- [ ] Demo scheduled with stakeholders
- [ ] Feedback collection process defined
- [ ] Sprint retrospective completed
- [ ] Next phase planning initiated

## Notes
This epic marks the transition from development to production. Focus on stability and documentation quality. The goal is to have a POC that stakeholders can evaluate and that the team can iterate on quickly. Consider creating a "launch day" checklist for coordinated deployment.
