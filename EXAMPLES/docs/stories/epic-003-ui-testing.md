# Epic 003: Admin UI & Test Runner
**Epic ID:** UI-EPIC-003  
**Duration:** 3 days  
**Priority:** P1 - Essential  
**Type:** User Interface & Testing  
**Dependencies:** CORE-EPIC-002  

## Epic Goal
Build an intuitive admin interface for ontology management and implement a comprehensive test runner that validates ontology integrity, Zep synchronization, and system behavior to ensure POC reliability.

## Epic Description

**UI Context:**
- Clean, functional admin interface
- Real-time data updates via Convex
- Mobile-responsive design
- Focus on usability over aesthetics for POC

**Testing Framework:**
- Automated test runner for ontology validation
- Zep sync verification
- Performance benchmarking
- Results visualization and history

**Success Criteria:**
- Admin can perform all CRUD operations via UI
- Test runner executes comprehensive test suite
- Results are clearly visualized
- Real-time updates reflect in UI immediately
- UI is intuitive without training

## User Stories

### Story 1: Admin Dashboard Implementation (UI-001)
**Points:** 5  
**Description:** Create the main admin dashboard with navigation, ontology list view, and real-time status updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard displays all ontologies in card/table view
- [ ] Status badges show sync state with Zep
- [ ] Quick actions (edit, delete, sync) available
- [ ] Search and filter functionality
- [ ] Responsive layout for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Real-time updates without refresh

**UI Components:**
```typescript
// Core UI components needed
- OntologyList
- OntologyCard
- StatusBadge
- QuickActions
- SearchFilter
- NavigationMenu
```

### Story 2: Ontology Editor Interface (UI-002)
**Points:** 8  
**Description:** Build comprehensive editor for creating and modifying ontologies, entities, and edges with visual relationship mapping.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Form-based ontology creation/editing
- [ ] Entity manager with property editor
- [ ] Edge relationship builder
- [ ] Visual graph preview (basic)
- [ ] Validation feedback in real-time
- [ ] Bulk operations interface
- [ ] Import/export functionality

**UI Features:**
```typescript
// Editor components
- OntologyForm
- EntityBuilder
- EdgeBuilder
- PropertyEditor
- GraphPreview (using vis.js or similar)
- BulkOperations
- ImportExport
```

### Story 3: Test Runner & Results Visualization (UI-003)
**Points:** 8  
**Description:** Implement test execution interface with real-time progress tracking and comprehensive results visualization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test suite selection and configuration
- [ ] Real-time test execution progress
- [ ] Pass/fail status for each test
- [ ] Performance metrics display
- [ ] Test history and trends
- [ ] Export test results
- [ ] Debug information for failures

**Test Categories:**
```typescript
// Test types to implement
- Ontology structure validation
- Entity/edge consistency checks
- Zep sync verification
- Performance benchmarks
- Data integrity tests
- API endpoint testing
```

### Story 4: User Assignment Management (UI-004)
**Points:** 3  
**Description:** Create interface for assigning users to ontology management tasks and tracking assignments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User list with role management
- [ ] Assign users to ontologies
- [ ] Track assignment history
- [ ] Basic permissions display
- [ ] Activity log view

## Technical Requirements

**Frontend Stack:**
- React/Vue/Svelte components
- Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
- Real-time Convex subscriptions
- Chart library (Chart.js or similar)
- Form validation library
- Toast notifications

**Testing Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Test runner requirements
interface TestRunner {
  executeTests(suite: TestSuite): Promise<TestResults>
  streamProgress(callback: ProgressCallback): void
  generateReport(results: TestResults): Report
  scheduleTests(cron: string): void
}
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- UI interactions < 100ms response
- Test runner can handle 1000+ tests
- Real-time updates < 50ms latency
- Dashboard loads < 2 seconds

## Dependencies
- CORE-EPIC-002 APIs available
- UI component library chosen
- Test framework selected
- Design mockups (optional for POC)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex UI requirements delaying POC  
**Mitigation:** Focus on functionality over polish, use component library defaults  
**Secondary Risk:** Test runner performance with large datasets  
**Mitigation:** Implement test chunking and background execution  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 4 stories completed and integrated
- [ ] Admin can manage complete ontology lifecycle via UI
- [ ] Test runner executes full test suite successfully
- [ ] Real-time updates working across browser sessions
- [ ] Basic responsive design implemented
- [ ] UI components documented
- [ ] Accessibility basics covered (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- [ ] Manual QA testing completed

## Notes
For the POC, prioritize functionality over visual design. Use existing component libraries to accelerate development. The test runner is critical for demonstrating system reliability to stakeholders. Consider recording a demo video of the UI in action.
