# Zep Impact Assessment POC - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an impact assessment solution for Zep graphs that allows previewing changes before permanently committing them.

## Key Findings

### i. Documentation Review
- **No native dry run**: Zep doesn't have a built-in dry run feature
- **Episode tracking**: Episodes have UUIDs and processing status (`episode.processed`)
- **Episode deletion**: Can delete episodes to rollback changes (`client.graph.episode.delete`)
- **Asynchronous processing**: Data is processed asynchronously (takes seconds to minutes)

### ii. Impact Assessment Solution

#### Approach
Since Zep lacks native dry run, we implemented:
1. **Snapshot mechanism**: Capture graph state before and after changes
2. **Episode tracking**: Monitor episode processing status
3. **Change detection**: Compare snapshots to identify additions/modifications
4. **Rollback capability**: Delete episodes to undo changes

#### Implementation Features

**GraphSnapshot Class**
- Captures entities, edges, counts, and type distributions
- Timestamps for temporal tracking
- Supports both graph_id and user_id

**ImpactAssessment Class**
- Stores before/after snapshots
- Tracks entities/edges added and modified
- Records processing time
- Indicates rollback availability

**ZepImpactAssessor Class**
- `capture_graph_snapshot()`: Records current graph state
- `wait_for_episode_processing()`: Monitors episode completion
- `compare_snapshots()`: Identifies changes between states
- `assess_graph_impact()`: Full impact assessment workflow
- `rollback_episode()`: Removes episode to undo changes

## Demonstration Results

### Test Scenario
Added sample company data to a new graph:
```
TechCorp is a software company founded in 2020 by Jane Smith.
The company has 50 employees and specializes in cloud computing.
Their main product is CloudManager, used by over 100 enterprises.
Jane Smith is the CEO and has 15 years of experience in technology.
```

### Impact Assessment Output
```
Episode UUID: e9949e85-4d93-4175-a4c2-3a1e0b44fc70
Processing Time: 6.44 seconds

ENTITY CHANGES:
- Before: 0 entities
- After: 3 entities
- Added: TechCorp, Jane Smith, CloudManager

EDGE CHANGES:
- Before: 0 edges  
- After: 3 edges
- Added relationships:
  • FOUNDED: Jane Smith founded TechCorp in 2020
  • IS_CEO_OF: Jane Smith is the CEO of TechCorp
  • USES: TechCorp's main product is CloudManager

New Entity Types: Entity_23346f76acdc4a0a9d2a5cd1917d6bd8
New Edge Types: IS_CEO_OF, USES, FOUNDED
```

### Rollback Verification
- Successfully deleted episode
- Graph restored to original state (0 entities, 0 edges)
- Rollback completed in ~5 seconds

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Search API limit**: Maximum 50 items per search query
2. **No true dry run**: Must add data then rollback (not preview-only)
3. **Thread messages**: Can't easily rollback user thread messages
4. **Processing time**: Must wait for async processing before assessment

### Production Considerations
1. **Concurrent access**: Other processes might add data during assessment
2. **Partial rollback**: Deleting episode only removes its specific changes
3. **Node persistence**: Nodes shared with other episodes won't be deleted
4. **Fact invalidation**: Invalidated facts remain marked even after episode deletion

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-deployment Testing
Test how new data sources will impact the knowledge graph before production deployment

### 2. Data Quality Assessment
Evaluate if incoming data creates appropriate entities and relationships

### 3. Change Management
Document and approve graph changes before committing

### 4. Debugging
Understand exactly what entities/edges are created from specific data

## API Usage

### Basic Impact Assessment
```python
assessor = ZepImpactAssessor()

# Assess impact
assessment = assessor.assess_graph_impact(
    graph_id="my_graph",
    data="Sample data to test",
    data_type="text"
)

# Review changes
assessor.print_impact_report(assessment)

# Rollback if needed
if assessment.rollback_available:
    assessor.rollback_episode(assessment.episode_uuid)
```

### Monitoring Episode Processing
```python
episode = client.graph.add(graph_id=graph_id, type="text", data=data)

# Wait for processing
while True:
    episode_status = client.graph.episode.get(uuid_=episode.uuid_)
    if episode_status.processed:
        break
    time.sleep(2)
```

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Batch assessment**: Assess multiple data additions together
2. **Visualization**: Generate visual diff of graph changes
3. **Approval workflow**: Integrate with approval systems
4. **Metrics tracking**: Record assessment history and patterns
5. **Custom entity/edge type detection**: Better identify type changes

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Test graphs**: Use separate graphs for testing
2. **Versioning**: Implement graph versioning system
3. **Shadow graphs**: Maintain parallel test graphs
4. **External backup**: Export/import graph state for testing

## Conclusion

While Zep doesn't provide native dry run functionality, our impact assessment solution successfully:
- ✅ Documents all changes before committing
- ✅ Lists entities and edges added/modified
- ✅ Displays entity and edge types
- ✅ Enables rollback via episode deletion
- ✅ Provides processing time metrics

This POC demonstrates a practical approach to understanding and controlling graph modifications in Zep.
