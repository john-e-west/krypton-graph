# Building a Chatbot with Zep | Zep Documentation

##### 

For an introduction to Zep’s memory layer, Knowledge Graph, and other key concepts, see the [Concepts Guide](/v3/concepts).

##### 

A Jupyter notebook version of this guide is [available here](https://github.com/getzep/zep/blob/main/examples/python/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb).

In this guide, we’ll walk through a simple example of how to use Zep Cloud to build a user-facing chatbot. We’re going to upload a number of datasets to Zep, building a graph of data about a user.

Then we’ll use the Zep Python SDK to retrieve and search the data.

Finally, we’ll build a simple chatbot that uses Zep to retrieve and search data to respond to a user.

## Set Up Your Environment

  1. Sign up for a [Zep Cloud](https://www.getzep.com/) account.

  2. Ensure you install required dependencies into your Python environment before running this notebook. See [Installing Zep SDKs](/v3/sdks.mdx) for more information. Optionally create your environment in a `virtualenv`.

    
    
    $| pip install zep-cloud openai rich python-dotenv  
    ---|---  
  
  3. Ensure that you have a `.env` file in your working directory that includes your `ZEP_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

##### 

Zep API keys are specific to a project. You can create multiple keys for a single project. Visit `Project Settings` in the Zep dashboard to manage your API keys.
    
    
    ZEP_API_KEY=<key>  
    ---  
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>

    ---|---  
    2| import json  
    3| import uuid  
    4|   
    5| from openai import OpenAI  
    6| import rich

    9| from zep_cloud.client import Zep  
    10| from zep_cloud import Message  
    11|   
    12| load_dotenv()  
    13|   
    14| zep = Zep(api_key=os.environ.get("ZEP_API_KEY"))  
    15|   
    16| oai_client = OpenAI(  
    17|     api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
    18| )  
  
##### 

We also provide an [Asynchronous Python client](/v3/install-sdks#initialize-the-client).

## Create User and Add a Thread

Users in Zep may have one or more chat threads. These are threads of messages between the user and an agent.

##### 

Include the user’s **full name** and **email address** when creating a user. This improves Zep’s ability to associate data, such as emails or documents, with a user.

PythonTypeScript
    
    
    1| bot_name = "SupportBot"  
    ---|---  
    2| user_name = "Emily"  
    3| user_id = user_name + str(uuid.uuid4())[:4]  
    4| thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  
    5|   
    6| zep.user.add(  
    7|     user_id=user_id,  
    8|     email=f"{user_name}@painters.com",  
    9|     first_name=user_name,  
    10|     last_name="Painter",  
    11| )  
    12|   
    13| zep.thread.create(  
    14|     user_id=user_id,  
    15|     thread_id=thread_id,  
    16| )  
  
## Datasets

We’re going to use the [memory](/v3/adding-memory#adding-messages) and [graph](/v3/adding-data-to-the-graph) APIs to upload an assortment of data to Zep. These include past dialog with the agent, CRM support cases, and billing data.

### Wait a minute or two!

##### 

We’ve batch uploaded a number of datasets that need to be ingested into Zep’s graph before they can be queried. In ordinary operation, this data would stream into Zep and ingestion latency would be negligible.

## Retrieve Data From Zep

We’ll start with getting a list of facts, which are stored on the edges of the graph. We’ll see the temporal data associated with facts as well as the graph nodes the fact is related to.

##### 

This data is also viewable in the Zep Web application.

The [`thread.get_user_context` method](/v3/retrieving-memory#retrieving-zeps-context-block) provides an easy way to retrieve memory relevant to the current conversation by using the last 4 messages and their proximity to the User node.

##### 

The `thread.get_user_context` method is a good starting point for retrieving relevant conversation context. It shortcuts passing recent messages to the `graph.search` API and returns a [context block](/v3/retrieving-memory#retrieving-zeps-context-block), raw facts, and historical chat messages, providing everything needed for your agent’s prompts.

## Creating a Simple Chatbot

In the next cells, Emily starts a new chat thread with a support agent and complains that she can’t log in. Our simple chatbot will, given relevant facts retrieved from Zep’s graph, respond accordingly.

Here, the support agent is provided with Emily’s billing information and account status, which Zep retrieves as most relevant to Emily’s login issue.
